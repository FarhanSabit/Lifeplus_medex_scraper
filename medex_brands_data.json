    "Indications": "Duofast is indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. This is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient\u2019s risk.",
    "Pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Substitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.Initial therapy: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily. Due to decreased clearance of Amlodipine among elderly patients the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine is 2.5 mg in patients 75 years. The lowest dose of the combination is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with this combination drug is not recommended in patients >75 years old.",
    "Interaction": "The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesartan Medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes should be closely monitored in patients on combination therapy and other agents that affect the RAS.",
    "Contraindications": "Cannot be co-administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects include peripheral edema, headache, flushing, and dizziness. It can also cause Intestinal problems known a sprue-like enteropathy.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should not be used in 2nd and 3rd trimester because it can cause fetal death. When pregnancy is detected this combination should be discontinued as soon as possible. It is not known whether Olmesartan and Amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should be used with caution because there is a risk for-\n\nHypotension in volume- or salt depleted patients.\nVasodilation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\nIncreased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute Ml in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.",

The incubation period varies from a few weeks to several months. Warts can spread by direct contact with a wart to damaged skin. ... Read moreThis is a topical solution indicated in the treatment of warts, corns and calluses.Information For Patients\n\nWarts: A wart is a viral infection of the surface layers of the skin. The incubation period varies from a few weeks to several months. Warts can spread by direct contact with a wart to damaged skin.\nCorns: A corn is a small, hardened area of skin which often looks yellow compared to the surrounding skin. It is typically round or cone-shaped, pointing down into the skin. Corns most often form on the feet and sometimes on the hands and are caused by constant or repeated friction or pressure.\nCalluses: A callus is rough, thickened skin spread over a wide area. Like a corn, it is caused by constant or repeated friction or pressure, but unlike corns, calluses are flat and have normal skin markings.",
    "Pharmacology": "Salicylic acid is a widely used and effective keratolytic, it produces desquamation and destruction of the epithelium by solubilising the intercellular cement of the Stratum Corneum. Lactic acid affects the keratinisation process, reducing hyperkeratosis and is also caustic, leading to the destruction of hyperkeratotic tissue. Collodion is derived from cellulose in a base containing ethanol and ether. It allows easy and accurate application of the product and dries to leave a film which hydrates the tissue and facilitates penetration of the active ingredients.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Unscrew bottle cap and with the help of brush applicator, apply to the affected areas. \u2018Before starting to use this topical solution, unscrew the fitted cap, discard it. Carefully remove the plug away from your body to avoid splashing into eyes/ face and discard it, replace with the brush applicator cap provided inthe sealed polybag given in the carton. This topical solution should be applied to the affected areas once daily, according to the following instructions:\n\nSoak affected site in hot water for five minutes.\nRub surface carefully with pumice stone or emeryboard to remove any hard skin. Dry with your own towel.\nApply this topical solution using the brush applicator supplied, taking care to avoid contact with normal skin.\nAllow to dry thoroughly and cover with plaster if lesion is large or on the foot to help penetration of active ingredients.\nContinue treatment once daily until the lesion is completely cleared and the ridge lines of the skin have been restored or when the corn can be removed.\nThe usual treatment period is 6 to 12 weeks.",
    "Interaction": "This topical solution may increase the absorption of other topically applied medicines. Therefore, concomitant use of this topical solution and other topical medicines on the treated area should be avoided. As systemic exposure of topically applied this topical solution is low, interaction with systemically administered medicines is not anticipated.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Do not use on open wounds, irritated or reddened skin, or any area that is infected. This solution should not be used on the face, anogenital regions, moles, birthmarks, mucous membranes, warts with hair growing from them, red edges or an unusual colour. Avoid applying to normal skin. This solution may cause eye irritation. Avoid contact with eyes and other mucous membranes. In case of accidental contact with the eyes or other mucous membranes, flush with water for 15 minutes. Avoid exposure to healthy skin. This solution may cause skin irritation. If undue skin irritation develops treatment should be discontinued. Consider alternative treatments if warts cover a large area of the body (more than 5 cm2) due to the potential risk of salicylate toxicity. This solution is not recommended in patients with diabetes, circulatory problems or peripheral neuropathy except under the supervision of a doctor. Oral salicylates taken during or immediately after a viral illness have been associated with Reye\u2019s syndrome and hence there is a theoretical risk with topical salicylates. Therefore, use is not advised in children or teenagers during or immediately after chickenpox, influenza, or other viral infections. It has been reported that salicylates are excreted via breastmilk. Patients should be advised not to inhale the vapour. Keep out of the sight and reach of children.",
    "Side Effects": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 and <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 and <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000), including isolated reports.Rash (common), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Application site reaction, pruritus, burning sensation, erythema, scaling, dryness (Very common), Skin hypertrophy (Common).Toxicities: In the event of accidental oral ingestion symptoms of salicylate toxicity may occur. The risk of developing symptoms of salicylate poisoning or salicylism is increased if this solution is used excessively or if it is used for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, duration of use and recommended frequency compliance is very important. Management should be as clinically indicated.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The safety of this solution during human pregnancy has not been established. Studies in animals given salicylic acid orally demonstrated embryo toxicity at high doses. D-film is not recommended during pregnancy. Salicylates are excreted in human milk. This solution is not recommended during lactation. If used or administered during lactation, care should be taken to avoid contact with the breast area in order to avoid accidental ingestion by the infant.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Duofilm is formulated for the controlled corrosion of keratin and thus care should be taken to apply the product to the affected area only. Do not use on the face or anogenital regions or if you are diabetic or have impaired circulation. Do not use on moles, birthmarks or unusual skin growths. Do not treat warts over large areas at one time, or use on infants and very young children unless on medical advice. For External Use Only",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Combined preparations",
    "Storage Conditions": "In view of its high inflammability, it is recommended that Salicylic Acid & Lactic Acid be stored in a cool place not exceeding 25\u00b0C. Keep away from naked flame.

    "Contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\nHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\nUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.",
    "Side Effects": "Immediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding. Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.",

    "Indications": "Duoliv tablet is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)\n\nwithout cirrhosis or\nwith compensated cirrhosis who do not have evidence of portal hypertension\n\r\nEither in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA.",
    "Pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action:\u00a0Obeticholic acid is an agonist for Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor expressed in the liver and intestine. FXR is a key regulator of bile acid, inflammatory, fibrotic and metabolic pathways. FXR activation decreases the intracellular hepatocyte concentrations of bile acids by suppressing de novo synthesis from cholesterol as well as by increased transport of bile acids out of the hepatocytes. These mechanisms limit the overall size of the circulating bile acid pool while promoting choleresis, thus reducing hepatic exposure to bile acids.Pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamic Markers: In the trial, administration of Obeticholic acid 10 mg once daily was associated with a 173% increase in concentrations of FGF-19 an FXR-inducible enterokine involved in bile acid homeostasis from baseline to Month 12. Concentrations of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid were reduced 2.7 micromolar and 1.4 micromolar respectively from baseline to Month 12. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.Cardiac Electrophysiology: At a dose of 10 times the maximum recommended dose Obeticholic acid does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Important Dosage and Administration Instructions:\u00a0Prior to the initiation of Obeticholic acid, healthcare providers should determine whether the patient has decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh Class B or C) has had a prior decompensation event or has compensated cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) because Obeticholic acid is contraindicated in these patients.Recommended Dosage Regimen: The recommended dosage of Obeticholic acid for PBC patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who do not have evidence of portal hypertension, who have not achieved an adequate biochemical response to an appropriate dosage of UDCA for at least 1 year or are intolerant to UDCA follows below:\n\nStart with a dosage of 5 mg once daily for the first 3 months.\nAfter the first 3 months, for patients who have not achieved an adequate reduction in ALP and/or total bilirubin and who are tolerating Obeticholic acid increase to a maximum dosage of 10 mg once daily.\n\nMonitoring to Assess Safety, Need for Obeticholic acid Discontinuation:\u00a0Routinely monitor patients during Obeticholic acid treatment for biochemical response, tolerability and progression of PBC. Closely monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis, concomitant hepatic disease (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease) and/or severe intercurrent illness for new evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) or increases above the upper limit of normal in total bilirubin, direct bilirubin or prothrombin time. Permanently discontinue Obeticholic acid in patients who develop laboratory or clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation, have compensated cirrhosis and develop evidence of portal hypertension, experience clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions, or develop complete biliary obstruction.Management of Patients with Intolerable Pruritus on Obeticholic acid: For patients with intolerable pruritus on Obeticholic acid consider one or more of the following management strategies. Add an antihistamine or bile acid-binding resin. Reduce the dosage of Obeticholic acid to:\n\n5 mg every other day, for patients intolerant to 5 mg once daily.\n5 mg once daily, for patients intolerant to 10 mg once daily.\nTemporarily interrupt Obeticholic acid dosing for up to 2 weeks. Restart at a reduced dosage. For patients whose dosage is reduced or interrupted, titrate the dosage based on biochemical response and tolerability. Consider discontinuing Obeticholic acid treatment in patients who continue to experience persistent, intolerable pruritus despite management strategies.",
    "Interaction": "Bile Acid Binding Resins:\u00a0Bile acid binding resins such as cholestyramine, colestipol or colesevelam adsorb and reduce bile acid absorption and may reduce the absorption, systemic exposure and efficacy of Duoliv. If taking a bile acid binding resin, take Duoliv at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after taking the bile acid binding resin or at as great an interval as possible.Warfarin: The International Normalized Ratio (INR) decreased following the coadministration of warfarin and Duoliv. Monitor INR and adjust the dosage of warfarin as needed to maintain the target INR range when co-administering Duoliv and warfarin.CYP1A2 Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Index: Duoliv may increase the exposure to concomitant drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates. Therapeutic monitoring of CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) is recommended when co-administered with Duoliv.Inhibitors of Bile Salt Efflux Pump:\u00a0Avoid concomitant use of inhibitors of the bile salt efflux pump (BSEP) such as cyclosporine. Concomitant medications that inhibit canalicular membrane bile acid transporters such as the BSEP may exacerbate accumulation of conjugated bile salts including taurine conjugate of Duoliv in the liver and result in clinical symptoms. If concomitant use is deemed necessary, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin.",
    "Contraindications": "Obeticholic acid is contraindicated in patients with:\n\nDecompensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh Class B or C) or a prior decompensation event\nCompensated cirrhosis who have evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia)\nComplete biliary obstruction",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects of Duoliv include: Pruritus, Fatigue & Stomach pain and discomfort. Other common side effects include rash, arthralgia (joint pain), oropharyngeal pain (pain in the middle part of the throat), dizziness, constipation, abnormal thyroid function, and eczema (inflammation of the skin).",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: The limited available human data on the use of obeticholic acid during pregnancy are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no developmental abnormalities or fetal harm was observed when pregnant rats or rabbits were administered obeticholic acid during the period of organogenesis at exposures approximately 13-times and 6-times human exposures, respectively, at the\u00a0 maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg.Lactation:\u00a0There is no information on the presence of obeticholic acid in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Obeticholic acid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Obeticholic acid or from the underlying maternal condition.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hepatic Decompensation and Failure in PBC Patients with Cirrhosis: Hepatic decompensation and failure, sometimes fatal or resulting in liver transplant have been reported with Duoliv treatment in PBC patients with cirrhosis either compensated or decompensated. Among postmarketing cases reporting it, median time to hepatic decompensation (e.g., new onset ascites) was 4 months for patients with compensated cirrhosis; median time to a new decompensation event (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) was 2.5 months for patients with decom- pensated cirrhosis. Some of these cases occurred in patients with decompensated cirrhosis when they were treated with higher than the recommended dosage for that patient population; however, case of hepatic decompensation and failure have continued to be reported in patients with decompensated cirrhosis even when they received the recommended dosage. Hepatotoxicity was observed in the Duoliv clinical trials. A dose-response relationship was observed for the occurrence of hepatic adverse reactions including jaundice, worsening ascites and primary biliary cholangitis flare with dosages of Duoliv of 10mg once daily to 50mg once daily (up to 5-times the highest recommended dosage) as early as one month after starting treatment with Duoliv in two 3-month, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with primarily early stage PBC. In a pooled analysis of three placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with primarily early-stage PBC the exposure-adjusted incidence rates for all serious and otherwise clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions and isolated elevations in liver biochemical tests per 100 patient exposure years (PEY) were: 5.2 in the Duoliv 10mg group (highest recommended dosage) 19.8 in the Duoliv 25mg group (2.5-times the highest recommended dosage) and 54.5 in the Duoliv 50mg group (5-times the highest recommended dosage) compared to 2.4 in the placebo group.Severe Pruritus: Severe pruritus was reported in 23% of patients in the Duoliv 10mg arm, 19% of patients in the Duoliv titration arm and 7% of patients in the placebo arm in Trial 1, a 12-month double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial of 216 patients. Severe pruritus was defined as intense or widespread itching, interfering with activities of daily living or causing severe sleep disturbance or intolerable discomfort and typically requiring medical interventions. In the subgroup of patients in the Duoliv titration arm who increased their dosage from 5mg once daily to 10mg once daily after 6 months of treatment (n=33), the incidence of severe pruritus was 0% from months 0 to 6 and 15% from months 6 to 12. The median time to onset of severe pruritus was 11, 158 and 75 days for patients in the Duoliv 10 mg, Duoliv titration and placebo arms respectively. Consider clinical evaluation of patients with new onset or worsening severe pruritus. Management strategies include the addition of bile acid binding resins or antihistamines, Duoliv dosage reduction and/or temporary interruption of Duoliv dosing.Reduction in HDL-C:\u00a0Patients with PBC generally exhibit hyperlipidemia characterized by a significant elevation in total cholesterol primarily due to increased levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). In Trial, dose-dependent reductions from baseline in mean HDL-C levels were observed at 2 weeks in Duoliv-treated patients, 20% and 9% in the 10 mg and titration arms respectively, compared to 2% in the placebo arm. At Month 12, the reduction from baseline in mean HDL-C level was 19% in the Duoliv 10 mg arm, 12% in the Duoliv titration arm and 2% in the placebo arm. Nine patients in the Duoliv 10mg arm, 6 patients in the Duoliv titration arm versus 3 patients in the placebo arm had reductions in HDL-C to less than 40 mg/dL. Monitor patients for changes in serum lipid levels during treatment. For patients who do not respond to Duoliv after 1 year at the highest recommended dosage that can be tolerated (maximum of 10 mg once daily) and who experience a reduction in HDL-C, weigh the potential risks against the benefits of continuing treatment.",

Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia.

Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient\u2019s risk.",
    "Pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Substitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.Initial therapy: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily. Due to decreased clearance of Amlodipine among elderly patients the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine is 2.5 mg in patients 75 years. The lowest dose of the combination is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with this combination drug is not recommended in patients >75 years old.",
    "Interaction": "The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesartan Medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes should be closely monitored in patients on combination therapy and other agents that affect the RAS.",
    "Contraindications": "Cannot be co-administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects include peripheral edema, headache, flushing, and dizziness. It can also cause Intestinal problems known a sprue-like enteropathy.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should not be used in 2nd and 3rd trimester because it can cause fetal death. When pregnancy is detected this combination should be discontinued as soon as possible. It is not known whether Olmesartan and Amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should be used with caution because there is a risk for-\n\nHypotension in volume- or salt depleted patients.\nVasodilation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\nIncreased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute Ml in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Combined antihypertensive preparations",
    "Storage Conditions": "Do not store above 30\u00b0C. Keep away from light and out of the reach of children."

    "Indications": "Duovas is indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. This is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient\u2019s risk.",
    "Pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Substitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.Initial therapy: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily. Due to decreased clearance of Amlodipine among elderly patients the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine is 2.5 mg in patients 75 years. The lowest dose of the combination is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with this combination drug is not recommended in patients >75 years old.",
    "Interaction": "The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesartan Medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes should be closely monitored in patients on combination therapy and other agents that affect the RAS.",
    "Contraindications": "Cannot be co-administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects include peripheral edema, headache, flushing, and dizziness. It can also cause Intestinal problems known a sprue-like enteropathy.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should not be used in 2nd and 3rd trimester because it can cause fetal death. When pregnancy is detected this combination should be discontinued as soon as possible. It is not known whether Olmesartan and Amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should be used with caution because there is a risk for-\n\nHypotension in volume- or salt depleted patients.\nVasodilation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\nIncreased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute Ml in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.",

Duphalac is only to be taken when these measures prove insufficient.Intestinal flora disturbances:\n\nIn damaged to intestinal flora (e.g. following long-term antibiotic treatment)\nGall bladder diseases\nIntestinal diseases (Colitis, Diverticulosis, Megacolon)\n\r\nIncreased blood ammonia levels (hyper ammoniemia in hepatopathy, portal-systemic encephalopathy)",
    "Pharmacology": "Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide. Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by the saccharolytic bacteria, producing low molecular weight organic acids (mainly lactic acid), which lowers the pH of the colon contents, promote the retention of water by an osmotic effect; thus increasing peristaltic activity. Lactulose is minimally absorbed; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of the absorbed material are not relevant to the principal therapeutic action.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "In constipation ( chronic constipation): \n\nAdults: Initially 3-6 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1\u00bd-6 tea-spoons daily\nChildren up to 14 years: Initially 3 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1-2 tea-spoons daily\nInfants and toddlers: Initially 1-2 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1 tea-spoon daily\n\r\nIn damaged intestinal flora:\n\nAdults: 1-2 tea-spoons daily\nChildren: 1 tea-spoon daily\n\r\nFor reduction of blood ammonia level: \n\nHyper-ammoniemia in hepatopathy: a maximum of 18-30 tea-spoons daily.\nIn portal systemic encephalopathy: hourly doses of 6-9 tea-spoons of Lactulose solution may be used to induce the rapid laxation. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose may then be reduced.",
    "Interaction": "There is no significant drug interactions with Duphalac. The glycosidic effect of cardiac glycosides can be intensified by potassium deficiency in abuse.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to either galactose and or lactose; galactose-free diet, gastro-cardial symptom complex, suspected intestinal obstruction.",
    "Side Effects": "Occasionally flatulence, cramp and abdominal discomfort can occur at the beginning of treatment; this is rapidly eliminated by reducing the dose. Overdose can result in diarrhoea. In abuse, loss of electrolytes (primarily potassium).",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "US FDA Pregnancy Category of Lactulose is B. Studies show that Lactulose has no adverse effects. Decisions regarding use during pregnancy and lactation must be made by registered physician.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Duphalac should be administered with care to patients who are intolerant to Duphalac. The dose used in the treatment of (pre) coma hepaticum is usually much higher and may need to be taken into consideration for diabetics.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Osmotic purgatives",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "It is estimated that more than 10 million pregnancies have been exposed to Dydrogesterone. So far there were no indications of a harmful effect of Dydrogesterone use during pregnancy. No data exist on excretion of Dydrogesterone in mother's milk. Experience with other progestogens indicates that progestogens and the metabolites pass to mother's milk in small quantities. Whether there is a risk to the child is not known. Therefore Dydrogesterone should not be used during the lactation period.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Before initiating Duphaston treatment for abnormal bleeding the etiology for the bleeding should be clarified. Breakthrough bleeding and spotting may occur during the first months of treatment. If breakthrough bleeding or spotting appears after some time on therapy, or continues after treatment has been discontinued, the reason should be investigated, which may include endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial malignancy. If one of the following disorders occurs during use for the first time or gets worse, stopping the treatment should be considered.\n\nSevere headache, migraine or symptoms that may indicate cerebral ischemia.\nMarked increase in blood pressure.\nOccurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE)\n\r\nIn cases of habitual or threatened abortion, the viability of the foetus should be ascertained.

    "Indications": "Durabolin is indicated-\n\nAs an adjunct to specific therapies and dietary measures in pathologic conditions characterized by a negative nitrogen balance\nFor the palliative treatment of selected cases of disseminated mammary carcinoma in women\nOsteoporosis.",
    "Pharmacology": "Nandrolone Phenylpropionate is an injectable anabolic preparation. The pharmacologically active substance is nandrolone. The phenylpropionate ester gives the preparation a duration of action of about one week after injection. Nandrolone is chemically related to the male hormone. Compared to testosterone, it has an enhanced anabolic and a reduced androgenic activity. This has been demonstrated in animal bioassays and explained by receptor binding studies. The low androgenicity of nandrolone is confirmed in clinical use.In the human, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has a nitrogen saving action. This effect on protein metabolism has been established by metabolic studies and is utilized therapeutically in conditions where a protein deficiency exists such as during chronic debilitating diseases and after major surgery and severe trauma. In these conditions, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate serves as a supportive adjunct to specific therapies and dietary measures. In women with disseminated mammary carcinoma, in selected cases Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has been reported to produce objective regressions for many months. Furthermore, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has been shown to produce relief of bone pain in patients with osteoporosis. The similarly acting nandrolone ester, nandrolone decanoate, has been shown to increase bone mineral content in these patients. Androgenic effects (e.g. virilisation) are relatively uncommon at the recommended dosages. Nandrolone lacks the C17alpha-alkyl group which is associated with the occurrence of liver dysfunction and cholestasis.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "As an adjunct to specific therapies and dietary measures in pathologic conditions characterized by a negative nitrogen balance: Recommended dose is 25-50 mg every week.For the palliative treatment of selected cases of disseminated mammary carcinoma in women: Recommended dose is 50 mg every week.Osteoporosis: Recommended dose is 50 mg every week.For an optimal therapeutic effect, it is necessary to administer adequate amounts of vitamins, minerals and protein in a calorie-rich diet. Nandrolone Phenylpropionate should be administered by deep intramuscular injection.",
    "Interaction": "Anabolic steroids may improve glucose tolerance and decrease the need for insulin or other antidiabetic medicines in diabetics.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in Pregnancy, Known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate or breast in the male.",
    "Side Effects": "High dosages, prolonged treatment and/or too frequent administration may cause:\n\nVirilisation which appears in sensitive women as hoarseness, acne hirsutism and increase of libido; in prepubertal boys as an increased frequency of erections and phallic enlargement, and in girls as an increase of pubic hair and clitoral hypertrophy. Hoarseness may be the first symptom of vocal change which may end in a long-lasting, sometimes irreversible deepening of the voice.\nAmenorrhoea.\nInhibition of spermatogenesis.\nPremature epiphyseal closure.\nFluid retention.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "This medicine is contraindicated during pregnancy because of possible masculinization of the foetus. There are insufficient data on the use of this medicine during breast-feeding to assess potential harm to the infant or a possible influence on milk production.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "If signs of virilisation develop, discontinuation of the treatment should be considered, Preferably in consultation with the patient.It is recommended to monitor patients with any of the following conditions:\n\nlatent or overt cardiac failure, renal dysfunction, hypertension or migraine (or a history of these conditions), since anabolic steroids may occasioally induce fluid retention:\nincomplete statural growth, since anabolic steroids in high dosages may accelerate epiphyseal closure;\nskeletal metastases of breast carcinoma. In these patients\nhypercalcaemia may develop both spontaneously and as a result of anabolic steroid therapy. The later can be indicative of a positive tumour response to the hormonal treatment. Nevertheless, the hypercalcaemia should first be treated appropriately and after restoration of normal calcium levels hormone therapy can be resumed;\nliver dysfunction.\n\r\nThe use of anabolic steroids to enhance athletic ability may carry severe risks to the user's health and should be discouraged.",

    "Composition": "Each 4 ml injection contains-\n\nBupivacaine Hydrochloride\u00a0USP 20 mg\nDextrose Anhydrous USP 320 mg",
    "Pharmacology": "Bupivacaine is a long acting local anesthetic of the amide type. Bupivacaine spinal 5 mg/ml is a sterile non-glucose containing solution. Bupivacaine spinal has a rapid onset of action. The duration of analgesia is 3-5 hours in the lower thoracic and lumbar segments, which makes Bupivacaine spinal especially suitable for long lasting procedures in the lower limbs. The muscular relaxation of the lower limbs is profound, and lasts 3-4 hours, being somewhat shorter than the duration of the sensory blockade. The circulatory effects of Bupivacaine spinal are similar or less than those seen with other spinal agents. Bupivacaine spinal is well tolerated by all tissues with which it comes in contact.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The following dosage recommendations should be regarded as a guide for use in the average adult: Spinal anesthesia for surgery: 2-4 ml (10-20 mg Bupivacaine hydrochloride) The patient's physical status and concomitant medication should be considered when deciding the dose, and the lowest dose required for adequate anesthesia should be used. Duration varies with dose, while segmental spread may be difficult to predict, especially with the isobaric (plain) solution. The dose should be reduced in the elderly and in patients in the late stages of pregnancy.Pediatrics: Bupivacaine may be used in children. One of the differences between small children and adults is a relatively high CSF volume in infants and neonates, requiring a relatively larger dose/kg to produce the same level of block as compared to adults.\n\n<5 kg: 0.40-0.50 mg/kg\n5 to 15 kg: 0.30-0.40 mg/kg\n15 to 40 kg: 0.25-0.30 mg/kg",
    "Interaction": "Bupivacaine should be used with care in patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs with local anaesthetic activity, as their toxic effects may be additive. Phenothiazines and Butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of epinephrine.",
    "Contraindications": "General contraindications related to intrathecal anesthesia should be taken into account absolute \n\nAllergy or hypersensitivity to amide type local anesthetics. Detection of suspected sensitivity by skin testing is of limited value.\nAcute active diseases of the cerebrospinal system such as meningitis, tumours (primary or secondary), and poliomyelitis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, cranial haemorrhage, demyelinating disease and raised intracranial pressure.\nSpinal stenosis and active disease or recent trauma in the vertebral column.\n\r\nRelative: Arthritis and other diseases of the vertebral column are relative contraindications due to technical difficulties in performing a spinal injection.",
    "Side Effects": "The adverse reaction profile for Bupivacaine is similar to those for other long acting local anesthetics administered intrathecally. Adverse reactions caused by the drug per se are difficult to distinguish from the physiological effects of the nerve block (e.g. decrease in blood pressure, bradycardia, temporary urinary retention), events caused directly (e.g. nerve trauma) or indirectly (e.g. epidural abscess) by the needle puncture or events associated to cerebrospinal leakage.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "It is reasonable to assume that a large number of pregnant women and women of child-bearing age have been given Bupivacaine. No specific disturbances to the reproductive process have so far been reported, e.g. no increased incidence of malformations. It should be noted that the dose should be reduced in patients in the late stages of pregnancy. With recommended doses, Bupivacaine enters breast milk in such small quantities that there is generally no risk of affecting the breast-fed child. At maternal serum levels of up to 0.45 g/mL produced by the epidural use of Bupivacaine for vaginal delivery, Bupivacaine could not be detected in breast milk during the first 24 hours after delivery (detection limit 0.02 g/mL).",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Local anesthetics react with certain metals and cause the release of their respective ions which, if injected, may cause severe local irritation. The ampoules are designed for single use only; any unused portions of solutions should be discarded. The solution should be used immediately after opening the ampoule. Solutions showing discoloration should not be used.",

    "Indications": "Duracef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections:\u00a0e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Duracef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: \n\n6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily\nChildren 1-4 years: 5 ml daily\nChildren 5-10 years: 10 ml daily\n\nIn typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
    "Interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "Duracef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Duracef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Duracef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Duracef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Duracef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Duracef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep below 30\u00baC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

    "Indications": "Duracef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections:\u00a0e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Duracef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: \n\n6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily\nChildren 1-4 years: 5 ml daily\nChildren 5-10 years: 10 ml daily\n\nIn typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
    "Interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "Duracef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Duracef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Duracef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Duracef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Duracef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Duracef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep below 30\u00baC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

    "Indications": "Duracef DS is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections:\u00a0e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Duracef DS is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: \n\n6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily\nChildren 1-4 years: 5 ml daily\nChildren 5-10 years: 10 ml daily\n\nIn typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
    "Interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "Duracef DS is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Duracef DS are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Duracef DS should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Duracef DS, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Duracef DS should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Duracef DS should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",

    "brand_id": "16541",
    "Indications": "Duratocin is indicated for the prevention of uterine atony and postpartum haemorrhage (excessive bleeding) following delivery of the infant by elective caesarean section under epidural or spinal anaesthesia.",
    "Pharmacology": "Carbetocin is a drug used to control postpartum hemorrhage, bleeding after giving birth. It is an analogue of oxytocin, and its action is similar to that of oxytocin; it causes contraction of the uterus. Carbetocin binds to oxytocin receptors present on the smooth musculature of the uterus, resulting in rhythmic contractions of the uterus, increased frequency of existing contractions, and increased uterine tone. The oxytocin receptor content of the uterus is very low in the non-pregnant state, and increases during pregnancy, reaching a peak at the time of delivery.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "A single intravenous dose of 100 mcg of carbetocin injection is administered by bolus injection, slowly over 1 minute, only when infant delivery has been completed by caesarean section under epidural or spinal anaesthesia. carbetocin is to be used as a single dose only.",
    "Interaction": "No specific drug interactions have been reported with Duratocin.",
    "Contraindications": "Because of its long duration of action relative to oxytocin, uterine contractions produced by carbetocin cannot be stopped by simply discontinuing the medication. Therefore, carbetocin should not be administered prior to delivery of the infant for any reason, including elective or medical induction of labour. Inappropriate use of carbetocin during pregnancy could theoretically mimic the symptoms of oxytocin overdosage, including hyperstimulation of the uterus with strong (hypertonic) or prolonged (tetanic) contractions, tumultuous labour, uterine rupture, cervical and vaginal lacerations, postpartum haemorrhage, utero-placental hypoperfusion and variable deceleration of foetal heart, foetal hypoxia, hypercapnia, or death. Carbetocin should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to oxytocin or carbetocin. Carbetocin should not be used in patients with cardio vascular disease, especially coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Carbetocin is not intended for use in children.",
    "Side Effects": "10-40% of patients experienced nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, itching skin, increased body temperature, trembling and weakness. Infrequent adverse events (1-5% of patients) included back pain, dizziness, metallic taste, anaemia, sweating, chest pain, dyspnoea, chills, tachycardia and anxiety.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Use of carbetocin injection is contraindicated during pregnancy. Small amounts of carbetocin has been shown to cross over from plasma into the breast milk of nursing women. The small amount of carbetocin ingested by infant would not be expected to present a significant safety concern.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "In patients who may not have an adequate uterine contraction after a single injection of Duratocin, more aggressive treatment with additional doses of oxytocin or ergometrine is warranted.\nAs Duratocin is closely related in structure to oxytocin, hyponatraemia may occur.\nDuratocin should be used cautiously in the presence of epilepsy, migraine, asthma or any state in which a rapid addition to extracellular water may produce hazard for an already overburdened system.\nPatients with eclampsia and pre-eclampsia should be monitored for changes in blood pressure.\nDuratocin is not recommended for use in elderly patients.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Drugs acting on the Uterus",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store at 2-8\u00b0C. Do not freeze. Keep away from light. Once the ampoule has been opened, the product should be used immediately."

Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

    "Pharmacology": "Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. Inhibition of PDE5 increases cGMP in smooth muscle cells. cGMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, causing penile erection. PDE5 also is present in smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder wall. Inhibiting PDE5 increases cGMP concentrations leading to relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder. Smooth muscle relaxation may improve blood flow to the urinary tract and widen the opening of the bladder neck, resulting in improved voiding.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Erectile Dysfunction: For most patients the recommended starting dose is 10 mg. The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg based on requirement. The maximum dosing frequency is once daily.

Read moreDuric is indicated for reducing urate/uric acid formation in conditions where urate/uric acid deposition has already occurred (e.g. gouty arthritis, skin tophi, nephrolithiasis). Duric is indicated for management of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) renal stones related to deficient activity of adenine phospho ribosyltransferase. Duric is indicated for the management of recurrent mixed calcium oxalate renal stones in the presence of hyperuricosuria, when fluid, dietary and similar measures have failed.",
    "Pharmacology": "Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is administered orally. It acts on purine catabolism without disrupting the biosynthesis of purines. It reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting the biochemical reactions immediately preceding its formation. Allopurinol is a structural analogue of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine. It is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism. Allopurinol is approximately 90% absorbed from the GI tract. Peak plasma levels generally occur at 1.5 hours to 4.5 hours. It has a plasma half life of about 1 to 2 hours. Approximately 20% of the ingested Allopurinol is excreted in the faeces.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: Allopurinol should be introduced at low dosage e.g. 100 mg/day to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and increased only if the serum urate response is unsatisfactory. Extra caution should be exercised if renal function is poor. The following dosage schedules are suggested: \n\n100 to 200 mg daily in mild conditions,\n300 to 600 mg daily in moderately severe conditions,\n700 to 900 mg daily in severe conditions.\n\nChildren: Children under 15 years: 10 to 20 mg/kg body weight/day up to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Use in children is rarely indicated, except in malignant conditions (especially leukaemia) and certain enzyme disorders such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.Elderly: In the absence of specific data, the lowest dosage which produces satisfactory urate reduction should be used.Dosage in renal impairment: In severe renal insufficiency, it may be advisable to use less than 100 mg per day or to use single doses of 100mg\u00a0at longer intervals than one day.",
    "Interaction": "When 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine is given concurrently with Duric, only one-quarter of the usual dose of 6- mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be given because inhibition of xanthine oxidase will prolong their activity. Evidence suggests that the plasma half-life of vidarabine is increased in the presence of Duric. When the two products are used concomitantly extra vigilance is necessary, to recognise enhanced toxic effects. Theophylline levels should be monitored in patients starting or increasing Duric therapy. An increase in frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with Duric compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs. Reports suggest that the plasma concentration of ciclosporin may be increased during concomitant treatment with Duric.",
    "Contraindications": "Allopurinol tablet is contra-indicated in patients with\u00a0known hypersensitive to allopurinol.",
    "Side Effects": "Rashes, gastro intestinal disorder\u2019s, rearly malaise, headache,\u00a0vertigo, drowsiness, visual and test disturbances, hypertension, alopecia,\u00a0hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, gynaeconastia and blood disorders.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There is inadequate evidence of safety of\u00a0Allopurinol in human pregnancy. Use in pregnancy only when there is no\u00a0safer alternative and when the disease itself carries risk for the mother or\u00a0unborn child. There are no data concerning the effects of allopurinol or its\u00a0metabolites on the breast-feed baby.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Duric should be withdrawn immediately when a skin rash\u00a0or other evidence of sensitivity occurs. Reduced doses should be used in\u00a0patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Patients under treatment for\u00a0hypertension or cardiac insufficiency may have some concomitant\u00a0impairment of renal function and Duric should be used with care in this\u00a0group.",

    "Indications": "Durogesic is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral morphine/day, at least 25 mcg of transdermal Durogesic/hour, at least 30 mg of oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.",
    "Pharmacology": "Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic. Fentanyl interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor but also binds to kappa and delta-type opioid receptors. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, Fentanyl exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Fentanyl may increase the patient's tolerance for pain and decrease the perception of suffering, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Fentanyl depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.",
    "Interaction": "Co-administration of different antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, CNS depressant drugs like ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazadone may enhance or prolong the effects of Durogesic. The concomitant use of amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil with Durogesic may also result in an increase in Durogesic plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.",
    "Contraindications": "Fentanyl is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain. This product must not be used in opioid non-tolerant patients. Fentanyl is contraindicated in patients with known intolerance or hypersensitivity to any of its components or the drug Fentanyl.",
    "Side Effects": "As with other narcotic analgesics, the most common serious adverse reactions reported to occur with Durogesic are respiratory depression, apnoea, muscular rigidity, myoclonic movements, and bradycardia. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur with intravenous administration if a dose is given too rapidly and it rarely occurs with intramuscular administration.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Fentanyl should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Fentanyl is excreted in human milk; therefore Fentanyl should not be used in nursing women because of the possibility of sedation and/or respiratory depression in their infants.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). Patients taking Durogesic should be warned of these dangers and should be counseled accordingly. The use of concomitant CNS active drugs requires special patient care and observation.Chronic pulmonary disease: Durogesic should be titrated with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression.\u00a0Head injuries and increased intracranial pressure: Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted.Cardiac disease: Intravenous Durogesic may produce bradycardia. Therefore, Durogesic should be used with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias.Hepatic or renal disease: Durogesic should be used with caution because of the hepatic metabolism and renal excretion of Durogesic.",

    "Pharmacology": "Dutasteride is a dual inhibitor of 5\u03b1-reductase. It inhibits both type 1 and type 2, 5\u03b1-reductase isoenzymes, which are responsible for the conversion of testosterone to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for hyperplasia of glandular prostatic tissue.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose is Dutasteride 0.5 mg orally once daily. The capsules should be swallowed whole. Dutasteride may be administered with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for subjects with renal impairment or for the elderly. Due to the absence of data in patients with hepatic impairment, no dosage recommendation can be made.Pediatric use:\u00a0Dutasteride is not indicated for use in the pediatric population. Safety and\u00a0effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established.Geriatric use:\u00a0No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and\u00a0adult subjects.",
    "Interaction": "Care should be taken when administering Dutamax to patients taking potent, chronic CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dutamax does not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of model substrates for the major human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) at a concentration of 1,000 ng/ml, 25 times greater than steady-state serum concentrations in humans. In vitro studies demonstrate that Dutamax does not displace Warfarin, Diazepam, or Phenytoin from plasma protein binding sites, nor do these model compounds displace Dutamax.",
    "Contraindications": "Dutasteride is contra-indicated for use in women and children and for patients with known hypersensitivity to Dutasteride, and other 5 a-reductase inhibitors. Warnings: Exposure of women-risk to male fetus: Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin. Therefore, women who are pregnant or may be pregnant should not handle Dutasteride capsules because of the possibility of absorption of Dutasteride and the potential risk of a fetal anomaly to a male fetus. If contact is made with leaking capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water.",
    "Side Effects": "Sexual problems (such as decreased sexual interest/ ability, decrease in the amount of semen/ sperm released during sex)\nImpotence (trouble getting or keeping an erection)\nTesticle pain or swelling\nIncreased breast size\nBreast tenderness.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The clinical significance of Dutasteride\u2019s effect on semen characteristics for an individual patient\u2019s fertility is not known. Pregnancy Category X. Dutasteride is contra-indicated for use in women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General:\u00a0Lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH can be indicative of other urological\u00a0diseases, including prostate cancer. Patients should be assessed to rule out other urological\u00a0diseases prior to treatment with Dutamax. Patients with a large residual urinary volume\u00a0and/or severely diminished urinary flow may not be good candidates for 5 a-reductase inhibitor\u00a0therapy and should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. Blood Donation: Men being\u00a0treated with Dutamax should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following\u00a0their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of Dutamax to\u00a0a pregnant female transfusion recipient.Use in hepatic impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on Dutamax pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Because Dutamax is extensively metabolized and has a half-life of approximately 5 weeks at steady state, caution should be used in the administration of Dutamax to patients with liver disease.Effects on prostate-specific antigen and prostate cancer detection: Digital rectal examinations, as well as other evaluations for prostate cancer, should be performed on patients with BPH prior to initiating therapy with Dutamax and periodically thereafter. Dutamax reduces total serum PSA concentration by approximately 40% following 3 months of treatment and approximately 50% following 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values, although it may vary in individual patients.",

    "Pharmacology": "Rupatadine is a long-acting, non-sedative antagonist of histamine H1-receptors. It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF \u03b1) in human mastocytes and monocytes.",

    "Indications": "Duvent is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of Seasonal & Perennial Allergic Rhinitis and Urticaria.",
    "Pharmacology": "Rupatadine is a long-acting, non-sedative antagonist of histamine H1-receptors. It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF \u03b1) in human mastocytes and monocytes.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults and adolescents (over 12 years): The recommended dose is 10 mg once a day.

    "Pharmacology": "Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and may delay or slow healing. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Difluprednate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "For the treatment of inflammation and pain associated with ocular surgery: Instill 1 drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye 4 times daily beginning 24 hours after surgery and continuing throughout the first 2 weeks of the post-operative period, followed by 2 times daily for a week and then a taper based on the response. For the treatment of endogenous anterior uveitis: Instill 1 drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye 4 times daily for 14 days followed by tapering as clinically indicated. For blepharitis: Instill 1 drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eyes 2 times daily for 1 week & then once daily for 1 week. For pseudophakic cystoid macular edema: Instill 1 drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eyes 2 times daily.",
    "Interaction": "Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Duxol 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion.",
    "Contraindications": "Difluprednate is contraindicated in most active viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures.",
    "Side Effects": "Adverse reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. Ocular adverse reactions occurring with Duxol included corneal edema, ciliary and conjunctival hyperemia, eye pain, photophobia, posterior capsule opacification, anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, conjunctival edema, and blepharitis for patient with ocular surgery.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. Difluprednate has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered subcutaneously to rabbits. Since use of Difluprednate during human pregnancy has not been evaluated so Difluprednate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus. It is not known whether use of Difluprednate passes into breast milk. Caution should be exercised when it is administered to a nursing mothers.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma & posterior subcapsular cataract formation. If Duxol is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored.\nUse of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution.\nFungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application.\nDo not touch dropper tip to any surface as this may contaminate Duxol.",

    "Interaction": "Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozymes are responsible for Duzela metabolism. When Duzela was co-administered with fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, the AUC, Cmax and t of Duzela was increased. Other drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 metabolism include cimetidine and quinolone antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin would be expected to have similar effects and these combinations should be avoided. Because CYP2D6 is involved in Duzela metabolism, concomitant use of Duzela with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher concentrations of Duzela.",
    "Contraindications": "Duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug or any of the inactive ingredients. Duloxetine is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Duloxetine should not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease. In clinical trials, Duloxetine was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis; therefore, it should be used cautiously in patients with controlled narrow-angle glaucoma.",
    "Side Effects": "The most commonly observed adverse events in Duzela treated patients were nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, decreased appetite, fatigue, somnolence, increased sweating, hyperhidrosis and asthenia.

    "Pharmacology": "Doxycycline Hydrochloride is a semisynthetic tetracycline antibiotic with broad spectrum activity. It is primarily a bacteriostatic antibiotic. It has a similar spectrum of activity to other tetracyclines but in particular is more active against Staphylococcus aureus and Nocardia. The drug is often active against penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and against strains of those organisms that are resistant to other Tetracyclines. Certain Gram-negative strains of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella, which are often resistant to Tetracycline, may be sensitive to Doxycycline. In addition, 70-90% of the various anaerobes are sensitive to Doxycycline and Bacteroides fragilis is more likely to be sensitive to Doxycycline than to other tetracyclines.Doxycycline is active against most strains of Haemophilus influenzaeand is particularly useful for infections with H. ducreyi, Actinomyces, Brucella and Vibrio cholerae. It is also active against Nocardia, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and a wide range of Rickettsiae. Doxycycline is active against spirochetes such as Borellia recurrentis, Treponema pallidum and Treponema pertenue. It is also active against Plasmodium falciparum.",
    "Interaction": "Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacid containing aluminium, calcium or magnesium, and iron containing preparation. Absorption of tetracyclines is also impaired by bismuth salicylate. Barbiturates, carbamazepine and phenytoin decrease half-life of doxycycline. Concurrent use of tetracyclines may render oral contraceptive less effective. Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosages. It is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.",
    "Contraindications": "Doxycycline is contraindicated to the patients who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines. Doxycycline is contraindicated to the children under 8 years of age. It is also contraindicated to pregnant women and to the lactating mothers.",
    "Side Effects": "Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin rashes, hemolytic anaemia, eosinophilia may be reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Doxycycline should be avoided in pregnant women, because of the risk of both staining and effect on bone growth in the foetus. Doxycyclines enter breast milk, and mothers taking these drugs should not breastfeed their child.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. Tetracyclines drugs, therefore should not be used in this age group.",

    "Pharmacology": "Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid which decreases inflammation by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses normal immune response.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "In general, glucocorticoid dosage depends on the severity of the condition and the response of the patient. If no favourable response is noted within a couple of days, continuation of glucocorticoid therapy is undesirable. In chronic conditions requiring long-term therapy the lowest dosage that provides adequate, but not necessarily complete, relief should be used.For tablet:\n\nIn adult patients, daily oral dosages vary from 1 mg to 10 mg and in children from 0.03-0.20 mg/kg body weight,according to the individual response.\nIn some patients higher dosages may be temporarily required,to control the disease. As soon as circumstances permit,dosage should be decreased.\nFor a short dexamethasone suppression test 1 mg dexamethasone is given at 11 p.m. and plasmacortisol measured the next morning.\nPatients who do not show a decrease in cortisol can be exposed to a longer test: 0.5 mg dexamethasone is given at 6-hour intervals\nfor 48 hours followed by 2 mg every 6 hours for a further 48 hours. 24-hour urine collections are made before, during and at the end of the test for the determination of 17 alpha-hydroxycorticoids.\n\r\nFor injection:\n\nDexamethasone can be given by intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) or local injection. Dexamethasone injections can also be diluted with an infusion fluid or be injected directly into the infusion line.\nIntravenous injections of massive doses should be given slowly, over a period of several minutes.\nIntramuscular administration should be given by deep intramuscular injection,to prevent atrophy of the subcutaneous adipose tissues.\nIntra-articular injections should be given under strictly aseptic conditions as glucocorticoids decrease the resistance to infection. When diluted with these infusion fluids, Dexamethasone will keep its potency for at least 24 hours (at room temperature and in daylight conditions). As infusion fluids, Sodium chloride 0.9%, Anhydrous glucose 5%, Invert sugar 10%, Sorbitol 5%, Ringer's solution, Hartman's solution (Ringer-lactate) etc.can be used.\nThe dosage of Dexamethasone depends on the severity of the condition and the response of the patient.\nFor systemic therapy in adults, daily doses of 0.05-0.20 mg/kg body weight are usually sufficient. For emergencies (e.g. anaphylaxis, acute severe asthma, cerebral edema) substantially higher doses are required. An initial dose of 10-20 mg IV is followed by 6 mg IV or IM every 6 hours,until a satisfactory result has been obtained. Thereafter the dosage has to be tapered off gradually.\n\r\nFor local therapy, the following doses are recommended: \n\nIntra-articularly: 2-4 mg in large and 0.8-1 mg in small joints\nIntrabursally: 2-4 mg;in tendon sheaths:0.4-1 mg\nThe frequency of these injections may vary from every 3-5 days to every 2-3 weeks",
    "Interaction": "Diuretics and/or cardiac glycosides, since potassium loss may be enhanced.This is a particular risk in patients using cardiac glycosides; since hypokalaemia increases the toxicity of these drugs.\nAntidiabetics, since glucocorticoids may impair glucose tolerance, thereby increasing the need for antidiabetic drugs.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, since the incidence and/or severity of gastro-intestinal ulceration may increase.\nOral anti-coagulants since glucocorticoids may alter the need for these drugs.\nGlucocorticoids may be less effective when used concomitantly with liver enzyme inducing drugs,such as rifampicin, ephedrine, barbiturates, phenytoin and primidone.\nIf patients undergoing long-term therapy with glucocorticoids are concomitantly given salicylates, any reduction in glucocorticoid dosage should be made with caution, since salicylate intoxication has been reported in such cases.\nAntacids;especially those containing magnesium trisilicate,have been reported to impair the gastro-intestinal absorption of glucocorticoids. Therefore, doses of one agent should be spaced as far as possible from the other.",
    "Contraindications": "Gastric and duodenal ulcers.\nSystemic and ophthalmic fungal infections.\nViral infections, e.g. varicella and herpes genitalis infections. Viral infections of the eye.\nGlaucoma.\nHypersensitivity to corticosteroids",
    "Side Effects": "The following adverse reactions have been associated with prolonged systemic glucocorticoid therapy.Endocrine and metabolic disturbances: Cushing-like syndrome, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, premature epiphyseal closure, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, decreased glucose tolerance, negative nitrogen and calcium balance.Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Sodium and fluid retention, hypertension, potassium loss, hypokalaemic alkalosis.Musculo-skeletal effects: Myopathy, abdominal distension, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads.Gastro-intestinal effects: Gastric and duodenal ulceration, perforation and haemorrhage.Dermatological effects: Impaired wound healing, skin atrophy, striae, petechiae and ecchymoses, bruising, facial erythema, increased sweating, acne.Central Nervous System effects: Psychic disturbances ranging from euphoria to frank psychotic manifestations,convulsions,in children pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) with vomiting and papilloedema.Ophthalmic effects: Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts.Immunosuppressive effects: Increased susceptibility to infections, decreased responsiveness to vaccination and skin tests.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C.There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Glucocorticoids appear in breast milk.Mothers taking high dosages of corticosteroids should be advised not to breast-feed",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment.The reduction should be gradual.Cardio-renal: These agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure,hypertension, or renal insufficiency.Endocrine: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage.Gastrointestinal: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation.Musculoskeletal: Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g.,postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy.Neuro-psychiatric: An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with myasthenia gravis or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). Psychic derangements may appear ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations.",

    "brand_id": "35493",
    "Indications": "Dyana tablet is indicated for the treatment of women with severe acne, unresponsive to oral antibiotic and other available treatments, with associated symptoms of androgenization, including seborrhea and mild hirsutism.",
    "Composition": "This tablet is supplied in blister pack units consisting of 21 tablets; each tablet containing Cyproterone acetate 2 mg and Ethinylestradiol 0.035 mg. Each cycle consists of 21 days on medication and a 7-day interval without medication (3 weeks on, 1 week off).",
    "Pharmacology": "Cyproterone is a steroid compound with potent antiandrogenic, progestogenic and antigonadotrophic activity. It exerts its antiandrogenic effect by blocking androgen receptors. It also reduces androgen synthesis by a negative feedback effect on the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian systems. The estrogen component (Ethinylestradiol) increases levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and thus reduces the free circulating plasma levels of androgens. Cyproterone has no tendency to reduce SHBG levels.If used alone in women,Cyproterone leads to menstrual cycle disturbances which are avoided when combined with Ethinylestradiol. When this tablet is administered in a cyclic manner, it has the added effect of preventing ovulation and possible conception.The components of this tablet are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Due to the long terminal half-life of Cyproterone, a 4-fold increase in plasma levels occurs after 6 to 12 days of daily dosing. Long-term therapy (36 months) with this product did not have a significant influence on lipid metabolism. A trend to increase plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels was observed. There was a slight decrease in low density lipoprotein (LDL) with a simultaneous increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL).",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This tablet should not be prescribed solely for its contraceptive properties. If patient compliance is uncertain and contraception is necessary, then a supplementary nonhormonal contraceptive method should be considered.First Treatment Course: The patient is instructed to take 1 tablet daily for 21 consecutive days beginning on day 1 of her menstrual cycle. (For the first cycle only the first day of menstrual flow is considered Day 1). The tablets are then discontinued for 7 days (1 week). Withdrawal bleeding should usually occur during the period that the patient is off the tablets.The first cycle will be somewhat shorter than usual, whereas all following cycles will last 4 weeks. The patient should be instructed to take the first tablet from the blister pack out of the section marked with the corresponding day (for example \"Mon\" for Monday) of the week and swallow it with some liquid. The patient should be instructed to take the tablet at the same time each day.Subsequent Courses: The patient begins her next and all subsequent 21-day course of tablets (following the same 21 days on, 7 days off) on the same day of the week that she began her first course. She begins taking her tablets 7 days after discontinuation,regardless of whether or not withdrawal bleeding is still in progress. Treatment should be continued for several months,since improvement may not be observed for at least 3 months. The need to continue treatment with This tablet should be evaluated periodically by the treating physician. This drug should be discontinued 3 to 4 cycles after signs have completely resolved.Pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing treatment with This tablet in patients who have missed a menstrual period, if pregnancy is suspected, medication should be discontinued.Missed dose: If the patient forgets to take a tablet at the usual time, the tablet may be taken within the next 12 hours. If more than 12 hours have elapsed from the time of usual administration, the patient must discard the missed tablet and continue to take the remaining tablets in the pack at the usual time in order to avoid premature withdrawal bleeding during this cycle. A supplementary nonhormonal method of contraception must be employed until the pack is empty to prevent pregnancy which would necessitate immediate discontinuation of this treatment.",
    "Interaction": "Concurrent use of the following drugs may result in reduced efficacy of this tablet and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding: Ampicillin, Analgesics, Antihistamines, Antimigraine preparations, Chloramphenicol, Griseofulvin, Isoniazid, Neomycin, Nitrofurantain, Penicillin V, Phenylbutazone, Sulfonamides and Tetracycline.Concurrent use of anticoagulants with estrogen/progestogen combinations may reduce the anticoagulant effect. Effectiveness of the following drugs may be altered when used concurrently: Antihypertensive, Benzodiazepines (those that undergo oxidative degradation), Beta-adrenergic blockers,Caffeine, Corticosteroids, Hypoglycemic, Phenothiazine, Theophylline, Tricyclic antidepressants and Vitamins.Concurrent use of the following drugs may reduce the efficacy of this tablet because of accelerated estrogen metabolism caused by the induction of hepatic enzymes: Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Pyrimidine and Rifampicin.Diabetics using estrogen/progestogen combinations may require adjustment of their antidiabetic medication. Concurrent administration of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) with estrogen/ progestogen combinations has been reported to result in a significant rise in plasma Ethinylestradiol levels.Rule out pregnancy before treatment is begun. Because of the antiandrogenic action of this tablet,feminization of male fetuses has occurred in animal studies and may possibly occur in humans.",
    "Contraindications": "Thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorders, or a history of these conditions\nCerebrovascular disorders\nMyocardial infarction or coronary artery diseases\nActive liver disease or hepatic adenomas or carcinomas\nHistory of cholestatic jaundice\nKnown or suspected carcinoma of the breast\nKnown or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia\nUndiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding\nAny ocular lesion arising from ophthalmic vascular disease, such as partial or complete loss of vision or defect in visual fields\nWhen pregnancy is suspected or diagnosed\nPrevious or existing liver tumors\nSevere diabetes with vascular changes\nA history of otosclerosis with deterioration during pregnancy.",
    "Side Effects": "Common side effects are Bleeding, Dizziness, Depression, Weight gain, Headache, Edema, Breast pain, Lactation, Blood clot, Gallstones..",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Fetal abnormalities have been reported to occur in the offspring of women who have taken estrogen/progestogen combinations in early pregnancy. Rule out pregnancy as soon as it is suspected. The use of estrogen/progestogen combinations during the period a mother is breast-feeding her infant may not be advisable. The hormonal components are excreted in breast milk and may reduce its quantity and quality. The long-term effects on the developing child are not known. This drug may cause fluid retention, conditions such as epilepsy.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Predisposing Factors for Coronary Artery Diseases: In women with predisposing factors for coronary artery disease (such as cigarette smoking, hypertension; hypercholesterolemia, obesity, diabetes and increasing age), the use of estrogen or progestogen combinations have been reported as an additional risk factor. After the age of 35 years, estrogen or progestogen combinations should be considered only in exceptional circumstances and when the risk/benefit ratio has been carefully weighed by both the patient and the physician. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious adverse effects on the heart and blood vessels from the use of this class of medication. This risk increases with age and heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is more marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use such medication should not smoke. Estrogen/progestogen combinations may cause an increase in plasma lipoproteins and should be administered with caution to women known to have pre-existent hyperlipoproteinemia. Lipid profiles should be determined regularly in these patients. The combination of obesity, hypertension and diabetes is particularly hazardous to women who are taking this class of medication. To avoid this triad of conditions develop, the patient should be placed on an alternate form of therapy. Discontinue medication at the earliest manifestation of: Thromboembolic and cardiovascular disorders such as: thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular disorders, myocardial ischemia, mesenteric thrombosis and retinal thrombosis. The use of estrogen/progestogen-combination products should be avoided in conditions which predispose to venous stasis and to vascular thrombosis, e.g. immobilization after accidents or confinement to bed during long-term illness. Under such conditions other nonhormonal methods of treatment should be considered. For use when surgery is contemplated, see Precautions.\n\nVisual defects, partial or complete.\nPapilledema, or ophthalmic vascular lesions.\nSevere headache of unknown etiology, or worsening of pre-existing migraine headache.\nOnset of jaundice or hepatitis.\nItching of the whole body.\n\nHypertension: Patients with essential hypertension whose blood pressure is wellcontrolled may be given the drug but only under close supervision. If a significant elevation of blood pressure in previously normotensive or hypertensive subjects occurs at any time during the administration of the drug, cessation of medication is necessary.Migraine and Headache: The onset or exacerbation of migraine or the development of headache of a new pattern which is recurrent persistent or severe, requires discontinuation of medication and evaluation of the cause.Diabetes: Diabetic patients, or those with a family history of diabetes, should be observed closely to detect any alterations in carbohydrate metabolism. Patients predisposed to diabetes who can be kept under close supervision may be given estrogen/progestogen combinations under strict medical supervision. Young diabetic patients whose disease is of recent origin, well-controlled, and not associated with hypertension or other signs of vascular disease such as ocular fundal changes should be closely observed.",

    "Contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Known or suspected progestogen dependent neoplasms (e.g. meningioma).",
    "Side Effects": "The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions of patients treated with Dydrogest in clinical trials of indications without oestrogen treatment are migraines/headache, nausea, menstrual disorders and breast pain/tenderness.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "It is estimated that more than 10 million pregnancies have been exposed to Dydrogesterone. So far there were no indications of a harmful effect of Dydrogesterone use during pregnancy. No data exist on excretion of Dydrogesterone in mother's milk. Experience with other progestogens indicates that progestogens and the metabolites pass to mother's milk in small quantities. Whether there is a risk to the child is not known. Therefore Dydrogesterone should not be used during the lactation period.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Before initiating Dydrogest treatment for abnormal bleeding the etiology for the bleeding should be clarified. Breakthrough bleeding and spotting may occur during the first months of treatment. If breakthrough bleeding or spotting appears after some time on therapy, or continues after treatment has been discontinued, the reason should be investigated, which may include endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial malignancy. If one of the following disorders occurs during use for the first time or gets worse, stopping the treatment should be considered.\n\nSevere headache, migraine or symptoms that may indicate cerebral ischemia.\nMarked increase in blood pressure.\nOccurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE)\n\r\nIn cases of habitual or threatened abortion, the viability of the foetus should be ascertained. It is also necessary to monitor during treatment whether the pregnancy is still progressing and whether the embryo is still alive. Patients with a history of depression must be carefully monitored; if severe depression recurs, treatment with Dydrogest must be stopped",

For doctors: If endometrial biopsies or ultrasound reveal inadequate Presentationational response, 20 mg Dydrogesterone should be prescribed. For patients: If you are not sure what type of oestrogen therapy you are on, talk to your Doctor before taking Presentation. There is no relevant use of Dydrogesterone before menarche. The safety and efficacy of Dydrogesterone in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years has not been established.",
    "Contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Known or suspected progestogen dependent neoplasms (e.g. meningioma).",
    "Side Effects": "The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions of patients treated with Dydron in clinical trials of indications without oestrogen treatment are migraines/headache, nausea, menstrual disorders and breast pain/tenderness.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "It is estimated that more than 10 million pregnancies have been exposed to Dydrogesterone. So far there were no indications of a harmful effect of Dydrogesterone use during pregnancy. No data exist on excretion of Dydrogesterone in mother's milk. Experience with other progestogens indicates that progestogens and the metabolites pass to mother's milk in small quantities. Whether there is a risk to the child is not known. Therefore Dydrogesterone should not be used during the lactation period.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Before initiating Dydron treatment for abnormal bleeding the etiology for the bleeding should be clarified. Breakthrough bleeding and spotting may occur during the first months of treatment. If breakthrough bleeding or spotting appears after some time on therapy, or continues after treatment has been discontinued, the reason should be investigated, which may include endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial malignancy. If one of the following disorders occurs during use for the first time or gets worse, stopping the treatment should be considered.\n\nSevere headache, migraine or symptoms that may indicate cerebral ischemia.\nMarked increase in blood pressure.\nOccurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE)\n\r\nIn cases of habitual or threatened abortion, the viability of the foetus should be ascertained. It is also necessary to monitor during treatment whether the pregnancy is still progressing and whether the embryo is still alive. Patients with a history of depression must be carefully monitored; if severe depression recurs, treatment with Dydron must be stopped",

    "Indications": "Dydroton is indicated in the management of hypertension. Dydroton is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy.",
    "Pharmacology": "Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-type Diuretic- Antihypertensive, used for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in association with other antihypertensive agents. Chlortalidone is also indicated for adjunctive therapy of edema associated with: renal disease; congestive heart failure of mild to moderate degree (functional class II, Ill), when glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 ml/min; ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver in stable patients; estrogen therapy; corticosteroid therapy.Chlorthalidone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule thus promoting water loss. The higher urine volume increases potassium loss. Little information is available on the absorption of the drug. Its long elimination half-life and clinical experience place it as a long-acting thiazide derivative. The longer-acting agents appear to cause increased potassium loss.Although a mild diuretic, its combination with loop diuretics is particularly potent because the latter presents much more sodium chloride to the distal tubule.The blood pressure lowering effects are initially due to volume reduction but the persisting effect includes other undetermined mechanisms that reduce peripheral resistance. A high salt intake reverses its antihypertensive effect.The major portion of an absorbed dose of Chlorthalidone is excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half life averaging 50 hours. Metabolism and hepatic excretion into the bile constitute a minor way of elimination. Within 120 hours, about 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine and in the feces, mainly in an unchanged form.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Therapy should be initiated with the lowest possible dose, and be titrated thereafter to gain maximum therapeutic benefit while keeping side effects to a minimum (e.g. determine the minimum effective maintenance dose for each patient). A single dose daily or every other day is given in the morning with food is recommended.Hypertension: Usual adult dose is 25 to 50 mg daily. The clinically useful dosage range is 12.5 to 50 mg daily. Doses greater than 50 mg per day increase metabolic complications and are rarely of therapeutic benefit. For a given dose, the full effect is reached after 3 to 4 weeks. If the decrease in blood pressure obtained using doses of 25 or 50 mg/day proves inadequate, combined treatment with other antihypertensive drugs (such as beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors) is recommended. When adding an ACE inhibitor, Chlorthalidone is to be reduced or discontinued.Edema of Specific Origin: The lowest effective dose is to be identified by titration. Maintenance doses should not exceed 50 mg/day and should be administered over limited periods only. The dosage should be individually adapted to the clinical picture and patient response. For long-term therapy, the lowest possible dosage sufficient to maintain an optimal effect should be employed; this applies particularly to elderly patients.The therapeutic effect of Chlorthalidone occurs even without salt restriction and is well sustained during continued use.The elderly: This is a suitable drug for treating hypertension in the elderly, in particular systolic hypertension. Dose of 50 mg daily, or less, should be used to avoid hypovolemia and hypokalemia.",
    "Interaction": "Other interactions: Patients with Special Diseases and Conditions in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, caution should be exercised since even minor alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance or of serum ammonia may precipitate hepatic coma. Treatment with thiazide diuretics should be initiated cautiously in postsympathectomy patients since the antihypertensive effects may be enhanced. A cautious dosage schedule should be adopted in patients with severe coronary or cerebral ateriosderosis.Drug Interactions-Antihypertensive Agents: Diuretics potentiate the action of curare derivatives and antihypertensive agents (e.g. guanethidine, methyldopa, beta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors).Digitalis:\u00a0Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may increase the likelihood of digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see also Precautions).Corticosteroids:\u00a0The hypokalemic effects of diuretics may be increased by corticosteroids, ACTH and amphotericin. Insulin and Oral Antidiabetic Agents: It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of insulin or oral antidiabetic agents in response to changes in glucose tolerance that Dydroton may produce.NSAIDs:\u00a0Concomitant administration of certain NSAIDs (e.g. indomethacin) may weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of thiazides, and there have been isolated reports of a deterioration of renal function in predisposed patients.Curare Derivatives and Ganglionic Blocking Agents: Thiazides may increase responsiveness to curare derivatives and ganglionic blocking agents.Allopurinol:\u00a0Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol.Amantadine:\u00a0Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the risk of adverse effects from amantadine.Antineoplastic Agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate): Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics may reduce renal excretion of cytotoxic agents and enhance the myelo suppressive effects. Anticholinergics (e.g. atropine, biperiden): The bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents, apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and rate of gastric emptying.Cholestyramine:\u00a0Absorption of thiazide diuretics is decreased by cholestyramine, therefore a decrease in pharmacological effect may be expected.Vitamin D:\u00a0Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium, and co-administration of Vitamin D may potentiate the increase in serum calcium.Cyclosporin:\u00a0Concomitant treatment with diuretics may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications.Calcium Salts:\u00a0Concomitant use of thiazide-type diuretics may cause hypercalcemia by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption.Diazoxide:\u00a0Thiazide diuretics may enhance the hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide.",
    "Contraindications": "Anuria, severe renal failure (creatinine clearance lower than 30 mL/min), severe hepatic failure, refractory hypokalemia or conditions involving enhanced potassium loss, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, symptomatic hyperuricemia (history of gout or uric acid calculi). Hypersensitivity or suspected hypersensitivity to Chlorthalidone and other sulfonamide derivatives or their excipients.Should be used with caution in patients with renal disease or with impaired hepatic function. Because of the possibility of progression of renal damage, periodic determination of the BUN and serum creatinine are indicated. Should there be an elevation of either parameter, treatment should be discontinued. Like thiazides, Chlorthalidone may lose its diuretic efficacy when glomerular filtration rate drops below 30 mL/min, a point at which treatment with loop diuretics may be more appropriate.Electrolytes: As with thiazide diuretics, kaluresis induced by Chlorthalidone is dose dependent, and there is inter-individual variability in magnitude. With 25 mg/day, serum potassium concentration decreases average 0.5 mmol/L. If chronic treatment is contemplated, serum potassium concentrations should be determined initially, and then 3 to 4 weeks later. If thereafter, potassium balance is not disturbed further, concentrations should be assessed every 4 to 6 months. Conditions that may alter potassium balance include: vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, change in renal function (e.g. nephrosis), liver cirrhosis, hyperaldosteronism, or concomitant use of corticosteroids or ACTH. Titrated co-administration of an oral potassium salt (e.g. KCI) may be considered in patients: receiving digitalis; exhibiting signs of coronary heart disease, unless they are also receiving an ACE inhibitor; on high doses of a beta-adrenergic agonist; whose plasma potassium concentrations are less than 3.0 mmol/L.",
    "Side Effects": "Electrolytes and Metabolic Disorders: Frequent: mainly at higher doses, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia and rise in blood lipids. Occasional: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia and hyperglycemia. Rare: hypercalcemia, glycosuria, worsening of diabetic metabolic state and gout.Isolated cases: hypochloremic alkalosis.Dermatology: Occasional: urticaria and other forms of skin rash. Rare: photosensitization.Liver: Rare: Intrahepatic cholestasis or jaundice.Cardiovascular: Occasional: postural hypotension, which may be aggravated by alcohol, anesthetics or sedatives. Rare: cardiac arrhythmias.CNS: Occasional: dizziness, slow mentation and decreased reaction time.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Chlorthalidone, like other diuretics, can cause placental hypoperfusion. Since they do not prevent or alter the course of EPH (edema, proteinuria, hypertension) preeclampsia, these drugs must not be used to treat hypertension in pregnant women. The use of Chlorthalidone for other indications (e.g. heart disease) in pregnancy should be avoided, particularly in the first trimester, unless the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks (e.g. when there are no safer altenatives).Lactation: Chlorthalidone appears in breast milk, attaining concentrations of approximately 4% of maternal blood levels. Therefore use in nursing mothers should be avoided.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Renal impairment: Dydroton dosage should be reduced in moderate renal failure - every 24 or 48 h - and should not be used in advanced renal failure. Liver disease: There is a risk of precipitating hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites. Use in pregnancy: It is better to avoid Dydroton as it crosses the placenta. Use in Lactation: In lactating mother, significant amount of Dydroton enter breast milk; like other long-acting thiazides, it can suppress lactation. Dydroton should not be prescribed for lactating mother.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Thiazide diuretics & related drugs",

    "Pharmacology": "Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Domperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\n\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\nChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\n\r\nIn dyspeptic symptom:\n\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\n\r\nIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\n\nAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\n\r\nBy rectum in suppositories:\n\nAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\nChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\nThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant administration of anticholinergic\u00a0drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs\u00a0should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The\u00a0main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the\u00a0concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma\u00a0levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide\u00a0antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has\u00a0gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered\u00a0drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in\u00a0patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of\u00a0domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\n\nneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\ndopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.",
    "Contraindications": "Domperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).",
    "Side Effects": "Side-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been\u00a0reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they\u00a0reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland\u00a0is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma\u00a0prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological\u00a0phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature\u00a0(as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally\u00a0excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Domperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did\u00a0not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used\u00a0during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit.\u00a0Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans.\u00a0The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in\u00a0breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether\u00a0this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are\u00a0taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk.\u00a0Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Dysnov should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier.

    "Indications": "Dystolic is indicated in-\n\nHypertension\nTreatment of essential hypertension\nChronic heart failure (CHF)\nTreatment of stable mild and moderate chronic heart failure in addition to standard therapies in elderly patients.",
    "Pharmacology": "Nebivolol is a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\n\ndecreased heart rate\ndecreased myocardia contractility\ndiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\nsuppression of renin activity and\nvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\n\nPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.",
    "Interaction": "Dystolic should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.Dystolic should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Dystolic may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Dystolic and clonidine, Dystolic should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine. CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Dystolic is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)",
    "Contraindications": "Nebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.",
    "Side Effects": "Headache, nausea and bradycardia.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Abrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Dystolic should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Dystolic is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Dystolic should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Dystolic be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Dystolic should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Dystolic should be considered.Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Dystolic was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Dystolic is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Dystolic can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.",

    "Pharmacology": "Nebivolol is a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\n\ndecreased heart rate\ndecreased myocardia contractility\ndiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\nsuppression of renin activity and\nvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\n\nPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.",
    "Interaction": "Dystolic should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.Dystolic should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Dystolic may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Dystolic and clonidine, Dystolic should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine. CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Dystolic is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)",
    "Contraindications": "Nebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.",
    "Side Effects": "Headache, nausea and bradycardia.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Abrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Dystolic should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Dystolic is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Dystolic should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Dystolic be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Dystolic should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Dystolic should be considered.Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Dystolic was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Dystolic is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Dystolic can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.",

    "Pharmacology": "Torasemide inhibits the Na+/K+/2CI- carrier system (via interference of the chloride binding site) in the lumen of the thick ascending portion of the loop of Henle, resulting in a decrease in reabsorption of sodium and chloride. This results in an increase in the rate of delivery of tubular fluid and electrolytes to the distal sites of hydrogen and potassium ion secretion, while plasma volume contraction increases aldosterone production. The increased delivery and high aldosterone levels promote sodium reabsorption at the distal tubules, and By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, torasemide indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. Torasemide's effects in other segments of the nephron have not been demonstrated. Thus torasemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance. Torasemide's effects as a antihypertensive are due to its diuretic actions. By reducing extracellular and plasma fluid volume, blood pressure is reduced temporarily, and cardiac output also decreases.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Congestive heart failure: The usual initial oral dose is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily.

Single doses higher than 200mg have not been adequately studied.Hepatic cirrhosis: The usual initial oral dose is 5 mg or 10 mg once daily, administered together with an aldosterone antagonist or a potassium sparing diuretic. If the diuretic response is inadequate, the dose should be titrated upward by approximately doubling until the desired diuretic response is obtained. Single doses higher than 40 mg have not been adequately studied. Chronic use of any diuretic in hepatic disease has not been studied in adequate and well-controlled trials.Hypertension: The usual initial oral dose is 2.5-5 mg once daily. If the 5 mg dose does not provide adequate reduction of blood pressure within 4 to 6 weeks, the dose may be increased to 10 mg once daily. If the response to 10 mg is insufficient, an additional antihypertensive should be added to the treatment regimen.",
    "Interaction": "Increased risk of severe hypokalaemia with amphotercin B, corticosteroids, carbenoxolone, hypokalaemia-causing medications. Increased risk of lithium toxicity.

It is not known whether topically administered calcipotriene or corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Calcipotriol and Betamethasone ointment or suspension is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been reported. If either occurs, discontinue until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize. Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome and unmask latent diabetes. Rate of adrenal suppression increased with treatment duration. Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops. Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acne form eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. Use is not recommended on face, axillae, groin or where atrophy is present. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids.",

    "Indications": "This\u00a0is indicated for the symptomatic relief of upper respiratory tract disorders accompanied by productive cough which benefits from the administration of a nasal decongestant, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist and an expectorant combination.",
    "Pharmacology": "Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant as well as a bronchodilator for the upper respiratory tract, which gives symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. Pseudoephedrine is both an \u03b1-and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It causes vasoconstriction via direct stimulation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors of the respiratory mucosa. It also directly stimulates \u03b2-adrenergic receptors causing bronchial relaxation, increased heart rate and contractility.Like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites, an indirect effect. This is its main and direct mechanism of action. The displaced noradrenaline is released into the neuronal synapse where it is free to activate the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors.Guaifenesin reduces the viscosity of tenacious sputum and is used as an expectorant. It increases the hydration of respiratory tract, thereby increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of bronchial secretions.Triprolidine is an antihistamine; it is used for the symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reactions including rhinitis, conjunctivitis and urticaria.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and Children over 12 years: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) three times a day.Children 6-12 years: 5 ml (1 teaspoonful) three times a day.Children 2-5 years: 2.5 ml (1/2 teaspoonful) three times a day.A physician\u2019s advice is preferred before administering this preparation to children aged less than 2 years.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant use of Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine with sympathomimetic agents such as decongestants, tricyclic antidepressants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants or with monoamine oxidase inhibitors which interfere with the catabolism of sympathomimetic amines may occasionally cause a rise in blood pressure. Because of its pseudoephedrine content, Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine partially reverse the hypotensive action of drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity including guanethidine, methyldopa, alpha-adrenergic blocking agents.",

Caution should therefore be exercised by balancing the potential benefits of treatment of the mother against any possible hazards to the developing fetus.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As with any other antihistamine therapy, Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine may cause drowsiness. If affected, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery. Concomitant administration of alcohol or other centrally acting sedatives should be avoided.

    "Indications": "E-coxib tablet is indicated for the symptomatic relief of-\n\nOsteoarthritis (OA)\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA)\nAnkylosing spondylitis, and\nThe pain and signs of inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis.\nFor the short-term treatment of moderate pain associated with dental surgery.",
    "Pharmacology": "Etoricoxib is a potent, orally active cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor within, and significantly above, the clinical dose range. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and adolescent over 16 years: \n\nOsteoarthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg once daily. In some patients with insufficient relief from symptoms, an increased dose of 60 mg once daily may increase efficacy.\nRheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\nAnkylosing spondylitis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\nAcute gouty arthritis: The recommended dose is 120 mg once daily. In clinical trials for acute gouty arthritis, Etoricoxib was given for 8 days.\nPostoperative dental surgery pain: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily, limited to a maximum of 3 days.\n\r\nSome patients may require additional postoperative analgesia. As the cardiovascular risks of Etoricoxib may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically, especially in patients with osteoarthritis.",
    "Interaction": "With medicine:\n\nOral anticoagulants: In subjects stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy, the administration of E-coxib was associated with an increase in prothrombin time.\nDiuretics, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs.\nAcetylsalicylic Acid: E-coxib can be used concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid at doses used for cardiovascular prophylaxis (low-dose acetylsalicylic acid).\nCiclosporin and tacrolimus: Although this interaction has not been studied with E-coxib, coadministration of ciclosporin or tacrolimus with any NSAID may increase the nephrotoxic effect of ciclosporin or tacrolimus.\nLithium: NSAIDs decrease lithium renal excretion and therefore increase lithium plasma levels.\n\r\nWith food & others: Take without regards to meals.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\nActive peptic ulceration or active gastro-intestinai (Gl) bleeding.\nPatients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors.\nPregnancy and lactation.\nSevere hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score 10).\nEstimated renal creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.\nChildren and adolescents under 16 years of age.\nInflammatory bowel disease.\nCongestive heart failure (NYHA ll-IV).\nPatients with hypertension whose blood pressure is persistently elevated above 140/90 mmHg and has not been adequately controlled.\nEstablished ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease.",
    "Side Effects": "Side-effects may include palpitation, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, ecchymosis; less commonly dry mouth, taste disturbance, mouth ulcer, appetite and weight change, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, chest pain, flushing, cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, anxiety, mental acuity impaired, paraesthesia, electrolyte disturbance, myalgia and arthralgia; very rarely confusion and hallucinations.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The use of Etoricoxib, as with any drug substance known to inhibit COX-2, is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. It is not known whether Etoricoxib is excreted in human milk. Etoricoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Women who use Etoricoxib must not breastfeed.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Caution is advised with treatment of patients most at risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication with NSAIDs; the elderly, patients using any other NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid concomitantly or patients with a prior history of gastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and Gl bleeding.\nPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with E-coxib after careful consideration.\nAdministration of E-coxib may cause a reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, and thereby impair renal function. Monitoring of renal function in such patients should be considered.\nCaution should be exercised in patients with a history of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or hypertension and in patients with pre-existing edema from any other reason.\nAny patients with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormalliver function test has occurred, should be monitored. If signs of hepatic insufficiency occur, or if persistently abnormal liver function tests (three times the upper limit of normal) are detected, E-coxib should be discontinued.\nE-coxib should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\nE-coxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation.

    "Pharmacology": "Doxycycline Hydrochloride is a semisynthetic tetracycline antibiotic with broad spectrum activity. It is primarily a bacteriostatic antibiotic. It has a similar spectrum of activity to other tetracyclines but in particular is more active against Staphylococcus aureus and Nocardia. The drug is often active against penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and against strains of those organisms that are resistant to other Tetracyclines. Certain Gram-negative strains of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella, which are often resistant to Tetracycline, may be sensitive to Doxycycline. In addition, 70-90% of the various anaerobes are sensitive to Doxycycline and Bacteroides fragilis is more likely to be sensitive to Doxycycline than to other tetracyclines.Doxycycline is active against most strains of Haemophilus influenzaeand is particularly useful for infections with H. ducreyi, Actinomyces, Brucella and Vibrio cholerae. It is also active against Nocardia, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and a wide range of Rickettsiae. Doxycycline is active against spirochetes such as Borellia recurrentis, Treponema pallidum and Treponema pertenue. It is also active against Plasmodium falciparum.",
    "Interaction": "Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacid containing aluminium, calcium or magnesium, and iron containing preparation. Absorption of tetracyclines is also impaired by bismuth salicylate. Barbiturates, carbamazepine and phenytoin decrease half-life of doxycycline. Concurrent use of tetracyclines may render oral contraceptive less effective. Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosages. It is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.",
    "Contraindications": "Doxycycline is contraindicated to the patients who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines. Doxycycline is contraindicated to the children under 8 years of age. It is also contraindicated to pregnant women and to the lactating mothers.",
    "Side Effects": "Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin rashes, hemolytic anaemia, eosinophilia may be reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Doxycycline should be avoided in pregnant women, because of the risk of both staining and effect on bone growth in the foetus. Doxycyclines enter breast milk, and mothers taking these drugs should not breastfeed their child.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. Tetracyclines drugs, therefore should not be used in this age group.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Tetracycline group of drugs",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep all medicines out of reach of children. Store in a cool and dry place, protected from light."

Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability.

The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures.

    "Pharmacology": "Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.Absorption: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.Distribution: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.Excretion: 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and Children over 8 years: 250-500 mg every six hours for mild to moderate infections. This may be increased upto 4 gm. or more daily in severe cases.Elderly: No special dosage recommendation. Erythromycin may be administered if desired, three times daily or twice daily by giving one-third or half of the total daily requirement 8 hourly or 12 hourly respectively. Children aged 2 to 8 years: 250 mg. every six hours or 30-50 mg/kg body weight per day divided into four equal dosage. Infants and Children upto 2 years: 500 mg. in divided doses or 30-50 mg/kg body weight in divided doses.",
    "Interaction": "Recent data from studies of E-Lid reveals that its use in patients who are receiving high dosage of theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In such cases this dose of theophylline should be reduced.",
    "Contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to Erythromycin.",
    "Side Effects": "Allergic reactions are rare and mild although anaphylaxis has occurred. Occasionally there is abdominal discomfort after oral administration, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. This discomfort usually subsides after a few days without it being necessary to reduce the dosage.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Clinical and Laboratory studies have been shown no evidence in human of teratogenicity or toxicity. However, caution should be exercised when prescribing this drug to pregnant patients and lactating mothers since erythromycin crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "E-Lid should be given with care in patients with impaired hepatic function, as E-Lid is excreted principally in the bile.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Anti-diarrhoeal Antimicrobial drugs, Macrolides",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep below 25\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children."

    "Composition": "Esomeprazole MUPS 20 Tablet: Each MUPS tablet contains 133.333 mg (15%w/w) of Esomeprazole enteric coated pellets equivalent to 20 mg Esomeprazole (as Esomeprazole Magnesium Trihydrate USP). Esomeprazole MUPS 40 Tablet: Each MUPS tablet contains 266.67 mg (15% w/w) of Esomeprazole enteric coated pellets equivalent to 40 mg Esomeprazole (as Esomeprazole Magnesium Trihydrate USP).",
    "Pharmacology": "The proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.",
    "Interaction": "E-Max MUPS is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that E-Max MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that E-Max MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. E-Max MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major E-Max MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of E-Max MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. E-Max MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, E-Max MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of E-Max MUPS. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of E-Max MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of E-Max MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",
    "Contraindications": "Esomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.",
    "Side Effects": "The most frequently occurring adverse events reported with E-Max MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "E-Max MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like E-Max MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light. Keep out of reach of children.",
    "Common Questions": "What is E-Max MUPS 20 mg MUPS Table?E-Max MUPS 20 mg MUPS Table is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid produced in the stomach.

    "Indications": "E-MUPS is indicated in:\n\nGastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).\nRisk reduction in NSAID associated gastric ulcer.\nH. pylori eradication (Triple therapy).\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion.",
    "Composition": "Esomeprazole MUPS 20 Tablet: Each MUPS tablet contains 133.333 mg (15%w/w) of Esomeprazole enteric coated pellets equivalent to 20 mg Esomeprazole (as Esomeprazole Magnesium Trihydrate USP). Esomeprazole MUPS 40 Tablet: Each MUPS tablet contains 266.67 mg (15% w/w) of Esomeprazole enteric coated pellets equivalent to 40 mg Esomeprazole (as Esomeprazole Magnesium Trihydrate USP).",
    "Pharmacology": "The proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.",
    "Interaction": "E-MUPS is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that E-MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that E-MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. E-MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major E-MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of E-MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. E-MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, E-MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin). Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of E-MUPS. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of E-MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of E-MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",
    "Contraindications": "Esomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.",
    "Side Effects": "The most frequently occurring adverse events reported with E-MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "E-MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like E-MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.",

After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole\u2019s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1\u20131.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",

The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole\u2019s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1\u20131.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.",
    "Interaction": "E-Proton is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that E-Proton is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that E-Proton does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.E-Proton may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major E-Proton metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of E-Proton 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. E-Proton inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, E-Proton may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of E-Proton.Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of E-Proton, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of E-Proton and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.",
    "Contraindications": "Esomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.",
    "Side Effects": "The most frequently occurring adverse events reported with E-Proton include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: Symptomatic response to therapy with E-Proton does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.Information for patients: E-Proton capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the E-Proton capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking E-Proton.",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.",

    "Pharmacology": "Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.",
    "Interaction": "Respite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of E-Reb with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.",
    "Side Effects": "In general, E-Reb is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. E-Reb may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.",

There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Symptomatic response to therapy with E-Reb does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with E-Reb 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\nA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\nPatients should be cautioned that E-Reb gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\nThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\nHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\nNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with E-Reb 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\nCo-administration of atazanavir with E-Reb is not recommended.\nTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\n\nHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: E-Reb, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping E-Reb. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, E-Reb 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.",

The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.",
    "Contraindications": "Losartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.",
    "Side Effects": "The side effects with the use of E-Tan are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Use of E-Tan during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of E-Tan is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.",

    "Pharmacology": "Sodium Picosulfate is a triarylmethane group derivative stimulant laxative. After oral administration it is activated by the colonic bacteria and acts locally in the colon. The active form then stimulates the nerve endings of the intestinal wall and results in colonic peristalsis with promotion of accumulation of water and electrolytes in the colonic lumen.

The rectal effect may help to restore the \"call to stool\".",
    "Dosage & Administration": "For oral administration. The following dosages are recommended to be taken at night to produce evacuation the following morning. It is recommended to start with the lowest dose. The dose may be adjusted up to the maximum recommended dose to produce regular stools.

    "Indications": "This saline is indicated in-\n\nAcute fluid and electrolyte loss conditions such as cholera, acute diarrhea & vomiting\nDehydration\nSeverely low concentrations of salts in the blood (severe electrolyte depletion)",
    "Composition": "For 500 ml water: Each sachet contains:\n\nSodium Chloride BP 1.3 gm\nPotassium Chloride BP 0.75 gm\nTri-sodium Citrate Dihydrate BP 1.45 gm\nProcessed Rice Powder Pharma Grade 25 gm\n\nFor 250 ml water: Each sachet contains:\n\nSodium Chloride BP 0.65 gm\nPotassium Chloride BP 0.375 gm\nTri-sodium Citrate Dihydrate BP 0.725 gm\nProcessed Rice Powder Pharma Grade 12.5 gm",
    "Pharmacology": "This saline contains essential electrolytes & carbohydrate (in the form of processed rice) which are vital for a dehydrating patient in conditions such as cholera, acute diarrhoea, vomiting & excessive sweating.In the normal healthy intestine, there is a continuous exchange of water through the intestinal wall- up to 20 liters of water is secreted and very nearly as much is reabsorbed every 24 hours- this mechanism allows the absorption of soluble metabolites from digested food into the bloodstream.In a state of diarrheal disease, the balance is upset and much more water is secreted than is reabsorbed causing a net loss to the body which can be as high as several liters a day. In addition to water, Chloride ion (CI-), extracellular sodium ion (Na+) & intracellular potassium ion (K+) are also lost. This saline is effectively replenishes the lost electrolytes in the body.The pharmacokinetics and therapeutic values of the substances of this saline are as follows:\n\nGlucose (comes from rice) facilitates the absorption of sodium (and hence water) on a 1:1 molar basis in the small intestine\nSodium and potassium are needed to replace the body losses of these essential ions during diarrhoea and vomiting\nCitrate corrects the acidosis that occurs as a result of diarrhoea and dehydration\n\r\nRice, a carbohydrate is converted to glucose through digestion. Glucose is then absorbed through intestinal wall with salt. Addition of rice (instead of pure glucose) to this formula reduces the osmolarity of the solution,thus preventing additional loss of fluid through stools.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The dose depends on the severity of the dehydrating conditions of the patients. Recommended dose after each watery stool are as follows:\n\n6 months to 2 years: 50 ml to 100 ml (10 to 20 Teaspoonfuls)\n2 years to 9 years: 100 ml to 200 ml (20 to 40 teaspoonfuls)\n10 years and above: 250 ml to 500 ml (1 to 2 glassfuls)\n\r\nReconstitution Procedure-\n\nPreparation for 250 ml saline: Wash both hands with soap before preparing the saline. Add 250 ml (one glassful) hot boiled water into a jar. Then add full sachet of this saline (for 250 ml water) powder into the jar. Mix the powder well in the water until a milky white solution appears. Give the solution to the patient to drink as per the dose.\nPreparation for 500 ml saline: Wash both hands with soap before preparing the saline.

    "Indications": "Easybak is indicated in-\n\nspasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis\nflexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus and muscular rigidity\nskeletal muscle spasm resulting from rheumatic disorders\nspinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases\ncerebrovascular accidents or neoplastic or degenerative brain disease",
    "Pharmacology": "Baclofen inhibits both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level by stimulating the GABAB receptors, which inhibits the release of glutamate and aspartate. It may also act at intraspinal sites producing CNS depression. Baclofen also exerts an antinociceptive effect.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult & children over 10 years: 5 mg 3 times daily, preferably with or after food, gradually increased; max. 100 mg daily.Children <10 years: Treatment is usually started with 2.5 mg (2.5 ml) given 4 times daily then raised according to requirement. Daily maintenance dose-\n\n12 month-2 years: 10-20 mg (10-20 ml)\n2 years-6 years: 20-30 mg (20-30 ml)\n6 years-10 years: 30-60 mg (30-60 ml)",
    "Interaction": "Increased sedation may occur if Easybak is taken with agents acting on the central nervous system, alcohol or synthetic opiates. The risk of respiratory depression is also increased.\nCombined treatment with Easybak and antihypertensives is likely to increase the fall in blood pressure; therefore the dosage of antihypertensive medication should be adjusted accordingly.\nThe concomitant administration of Easybak and tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the pharmacological effects of Easybak resulting in pronounced muscular hypotonia.\nIn patients with Parkinsons disease receiving treatment with Easybak and levodopa and carbidopa, there have been several reports of mental confusion, hallucinations, headaches, nausea and agitation.\nThe concurrent use of MAO inhibitors and Easybak may result in increased CNS depressant effects. Caution is advised and the dosage of one or both agents should be adjusted accordingly.\nCaution should be exercised when administering Easybak and magnesium sulphate or other neuromuscular blocking agents since a synergistic effect may theoretically occur.",
    "Contraindications": "Baclofen is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common adverse reactions associated with Easybak are transient drowsiness, daytime sedation, dizziness, weakness and fatigue.\n\nCentral Nervous System: Headache (<10%), insomnia (<10%), and rarely, euphoria, excitement, depression, confusion, hallucinations, paraesthesia, nightmares, muscle pain, tinnitus, slurred speech, co-ordination disorder, tremor, rigidity, dystonia, ataxia, blurred vision, nystagmus, strabismus, miosis, mydriasis, diplopia, dysarthria, epileptic seizures, respiratory depression.\nCardiovascular: Hypotension (<10%), rare instances of dyspnoea, palpitation, chest pain, syncope.\nGastrointestinal: Nausea (approximately 10%), constipation (<10%) and rarely, dry mouth, anorexia, taste disorder, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and positive test for occult blood in stool.\nGenitourinary: Urinary frequency (<10%) and rarely, enuresis, urinary retention, dysuria, impotence, inability to ejaculate, nocturia, haematuria.\nOther: Instances of rash, pruritus, ankle oedema, excessive perspiration, weight gain, nasal congestion, visual disturbances, hepatic function disorders and paradoxical increase in spasticity. Muscular hypotonia of a degree sufficient to make walking or movement difficult may occur but is usually relieved by readjusting the dosage. For this purpose, the daytime dosage may be reduced and the evening dosage increased.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category B3. Safe use of Baclofen during pregnancy has not been established. Baclofen crosses the placental barrier. Baclofen should only be administered to pregnant women when in the judgement of the physician concludes that the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Baclofen is excreted in breast milk however evidence to date suggests that the quantities are so small that no undesirable effects on the infant would be expected.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Lower doses (approximately 5 mg per day) should be used for patients with impaired renal function or those undergoing chronic haemodialysis.\nPatients suffering not only from spasticity but also from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, depressive or manic disorders or confusional states should be treated cautiously and closely monitored as exacerbations of these disorders may occur.\nIn patients with epilepsy and muscle spasticity, Easybak may be used under appropriate supervision and provided that adequate anticonvulsive therapy is continued. Lowering of the convulsion threshold may occur and seizures have been reported after the cessation of Easybak therapy or with overdose.\nEasybak should be used with caution in patients with or with a history of peptic ulcers, cerebrovascular diseases, or hepatic, renal or respiratory failure.\nCareful monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function is essential especially in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and respiratory muscle weakness.\nDuring treatment with Easybak, neurogenic disturbances affecting emptying of the bladder may improve. However in patients with preexisting sphincter hypertonia, acute retention of urine may occur. Easybak should be used with caution in these circumstances.\nEasybak has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerance to the medicine.\nAppropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically in patients with hepatic diseases or diabetes mellitus to ensure that no medicine induced changes in these underlying diseases have occurred.",

Read moreEasycal tablet is used to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels in people who do not get enough calcium from their diets. To fulfill the calcium deficiency or meet extra need of calcium, it may be used in conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, latent tetany, postmenopausal osteoporosis, senile osteoporosis, juvenile osteoporosis, drug (phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone) induced osteoporosis, pregnancy and lactation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), hypoparathyroidism and hip joint plastic surgery.Easycal acts against a number of inflammatory diseases like arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, spondylitis, various cardiovascular ailments, encephalitis, retinitis, phlebitis, colitis, and multiple sclerosis. Easycal helps in controlling weight by suppressing the habit of frequent appetite of chronic overeaters. It is also beneficial in reducing the effects of mood swings and is proved to be quite effective in cognitive enhancement. Easycal protects the heart by enhancing the efficiency of cardiac muscles. Recent studies on Easycal indicate its potential to minimize the risk of colon cancer.",
    "Pharmacology": "This contains Calcium Orotate, a calcium supplement with a functional amino acid chelating ligand- orotic acid. Orotic acid assists the transport of calcium through cellular membrane structures, thus facilitating the intracellular uptake of calcium, particularly in bone. Calcium Orotate also helps in the maintenance of healthy cartilage. Furthermore, Orotate is involved in the synthesis of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) of the various calcium supplements on the market, Calcium Orotate gets high marks because of the compound's ability to penetrate complex cell membranes so that it can be metabolized in cartilage.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Calcium Orotate 400 mg: As an addition to the daily diet, 2-3 tablets are usually recommended with meal or as directed by a physician.Calcium Orotate 740 mg: As an addition to the daily diet, 1-2 tablets are usually recommended with meal or as directed by a physician.",
    "Interaction": "Easycal can decrease absorption of the following drugs when taken together: biphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), quinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), and tetracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline), levothyroxine, phenytoin (an anticonvulsant), and tiludronate disodium (to treat Paget's disease). Thiazide-type diuretics can interact with Easycal supplements, increasing the risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Both aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids increase urinary calcium excretion. Mineral oil and stimulant laxatives decrease calcium absorption. Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, can cause calcium depletion and eventually osteoporosis when they are used for months. Oral contraceptives as well as estrogen compounds reduce calcium. Anti-inflammatories such as NSAIDs, Aspirin, Ibuprofen deplete calcium. Corticosteroids deplete calcium.",
    "Contraindications": "Calcium Orotate is contraindicated in conditions like incomplete or infrequent bowel movements, kidney stone, kidney disease, increased activity of the parathyroid gland, high amount of Calcium in urine, high amount of Calcium in the blood, extreme loss of body water.",
    "Side Effects": "Bloating and swelling in the abdomen are common side effects of Easycal. Loss of appetite, upset stomach, constipation, nausea, vomiting, unusual weight loss, increased thirst/urination, weakness, unusual tiredness, formation of kidney stones may occur infrequently.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Women who are pregnant and breast-feeding need more calcium. Pregnancy related high blood pressure is a common and serious risk for women and their babies, and taking supplemental forms of Calcium Orotate can help to reduce this risk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Before taking Easycal, precaution is needed if the patient is allergic to Easycal. Easycal may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Precaution is needed before using Easycal in kidney disease, kidney stones, little or no stomach acid (achlorhydria), heart disease, disease of the pancreas, sarcoidosis difficulty absorbing nutrition from food (malabsorption syndrome).",

Read moreAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:\u03b2 carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with \u03b2 carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
    "Pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this\u00a0tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of \u03b2 carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
    "Contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
    "Side Effects": "\u03b2 carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "\u03b2 carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "There are some evidences that \u03b2 carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Anti-oxidant Multivitamin preparations",
    "Storage Conditions": "Should be stored in a dry place below 30\u02daC."

Read moreAcute and chronic anxiety states which may produce the following symptoms in particular: anxiety, tension, restlessness, excitement, irritability, sleep disturbances from emotional causes, psychovegetative and psychosomatic disorders (for example, in the cardiovascular or gastrointestinal area), and emotional instability.In patients with depression or anxiety associated with depression, Ebazam must be used only in conjunction with adequate concomitant treatment. Use of benzodiazepines alone, can precipitate suicide in such patients. Before treatment of anxiety states associated with emotional instability, it must first be determined whether the patient suffers from a depressive disorder requiring adjunctive or different treatment.In patients with schizophrenic or other psychotic illnesses, use of benzodiazepines is recommended only for adjunctive, i.e. not for primary treatment.As adjunctive therapy in patients with epilepsy who are not adequately stabilized with their anticonvulsant monotherapy.",
    "Pharmacology": "Clobazam binds at distinct binding sites associated with the chloride ionopore at the post-synaptic GABA receptor. These GABA receptors are in various locations in the CNS (limbic, reticular formation) and clobazam increases the duration of time for which the chloride ionopore is open. As a result, hyper polarization and stabilization of the membrane occur as the post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA is enhanced.",
    "Interaction": "Alcohol: Concomitant consumption of alcohol can increase the bioavailability of Ebazam by 50% and therefore lead to increased Ebazam effects.Central nervous system depressant drugs: Especially when Ebazam is administered in higher doses, a mutually potentiating effect is to be expected if other central nervous system depressant drugs (such as antipsychotics, anxiolytics, certain antidepressant agents, anticonvulsant drugs, sedative antihistamines, anaesthetics, hypnotics or narcotic analgesics, or other sedatives) are taken at the same time. Special caution is also necessary when Ebazam is administered in cases of intoxication with such substances or with lithium.Opioids: The concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Ebazam, and opioids increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death because of the additive CNS depressant effect. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids.Anticonvulsants: If Ebazam is administered simultaneously with anticonvulsants in the treatment of epilepsy, the dosage must be adjusted under regular medical supervision (EEG monitoring), as there may be interactions with the patient's basic anticonvulsant medication. In patients receiving concomitant treatment with valproic acid, there may be a slight to moderate rise in plasma valproic acid concentration. Phenytoin plasma levels may rise if patients receive concomitant treatment with Ebazam. Where possible, it is recommended that blood levels of concomitantly administered valproic acid or phenytoin be monitored. Carbamazepine and phenytoin may cause an increase in the metabolic conversion of Ebazam to the active metabolite N-desmethyl Ebazam. Stiripentol increases plasma levels of Ebazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylEbazam, through inhibition of CYP3A and CYP2C19. Monitoring of blood levels is recommended, prior to initiation of stiripentol, and then once new steady-state concentration has been reached, i.e. after 2 weeks approximately.Narcotic analgesics: If Ebazam is used concomitantly with narcotic analgesics, possible euphoria may be enhanced; this may lead to increased psychological dependence.Muscle relaxants: The effects of muscle relaxants and nitrous oxide may be enhanced.CYP 2C19 inhibitors: Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 may result in increased exposure to N-desmethylEbazam (N-CLB), the active metabolite of Ebazam. Dosage adjustment of Ebazam may be necessary when co-administered with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., cannabidiol containing medicinal products, fuconazole, fuvoxamine, ticlopidine) or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole).CYP 2D6 substrates: Ebazam is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. Dose adjustment of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g. dextromethorphan, pimozide, paroxetine, nebivolol) may be necessary.",
    "Contraindications": "Clobazam must not be used-\n\nIn patients with hypersensitivity to clobazam or any of the excipients of Clobazam.\nIn patients with myasthenia gravis (risk of aggravation of muscle weakness).\nIn patients with severe respiratory insufciency (risk of deterioration).\nIn patients with sleep apnoea syndrome (risk of deterioration).\nIn patients with severe impairment of liver function (risk of precipitating encephalopathy).\nIn breast-feeding women Benzodiazepines must not be given to children without careful assessment of the need for their use.\nClobazam must not be used in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, other than in exceptional cases for anticonvulsant treatment where there is a compelling indication.",
    "Side Effects": "Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Common: decreased appetitePsychiatric disorders: Common: irritability, aggression, restlessness, depression (pre-existing depression may be unmasked), drug tolerance (especially during prolonged use), agitation.Nervous system disorders: Very common: somnolence, especially at the beginning of treatment and when higher doses are used; Common: sedation, dizziness, disturbance in attention, slow speech/dysarthria/ speech disorder (particularly with high doses or in long-term treatment, and are reversible), headache, tremor, ataxia.Eye Disorders: Uncommon: diplopia (particularly with high doses or in long-term treatment and is reversible)Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Not known: respiratory depression respiratory failure (particularly in patients with pre-existing compromised respiratory function e.g. in patients with bronchial asthma or brain damage)Gastrointestinal disorders: Common: dry mouth, nausea, constipationSkin and subcutaneous disorders: Uncommon: rash; Not known: photosensitivity reaction urticaria; Steven Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (including some cases with fatal outcome);Musculoskeleteal and connective tissue disorders: Not known: muscle spasms, muscle weaknessGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Very common: fatigue, especially at the beginning of treatment and when higher doses are used. Not known: slow response to stimuli, hypothermiaInvestigations: Uncommon: weight increased (particularly with high doses or in long-term treatment).",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Clobazam is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Clobazam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal studies have demonstrated reproductive toxicity. Clobazam crosses the placenta. In the post-marketing safety database, limited data on exposed pregnancies are available with clobazam. A large amount of data collected from cohort studies has not demonstrated evidence of the occurrence of malformations following exposure to benzodiazepines during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, in certain epidemiological case-control studies, an increased incidence of cleft lip and palate was observed with benzodiazepines. Cases of reduced fetal movement and fetal heart rate variability have been described after administration of benzodiazepines during the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy. Administration of clobazam during the late phase of pregnancy or during childbirth can result in the occurrence of neonatal respiratory depression (including respiratory distress and apnea), which may be associated with other disorders such as sedation signs, hypothermia, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties (which may result in poor weight gain) in the newborn (signs and symptoms of the so-called \"floppy infant syndrome\"). Moreover, infants born to mothers who have taken benzodiazepines over longer periods during the later stages of pregnancy may have developed physical dependence and may be at risk of developing a withdrawal syndrome in the postnatal period. Appropriate monitoring of the newborn in the postnatal period is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should be informed of the risks and benefits of the use of Clobazam during pregnancy. If a woman plans a pregnancy or becomes pregnant, carefully evaluate the risks and benefits and whether treatment with Clobazam should be discontinued. If Clobazam treatment is to be continued, use Clobazam at the lowest effective dose.Lactation: Clobazam must not be used in breastfeeding women, since clobazam passes into breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported with Ebazam in both children and adults during the post-marketing experience. A majority of the reported cases involved the concomitant use of other drugs, including antiepileptic drugs that are associated with serious skin reactions. SJS/TEN could be associated with a fatal outcome. Patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of SJS/TEN, especially during the first 8 weeks of treatment. Ebazam should be immediately discontinued when SJS/TEN is suspected. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of Ebazam should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.Respiratory depression: Ebazam can cause respiratory depression, especially if administered in high doses. Therefore in patients with chronic or acute respiratory insufficiency, respiratory function must be monitored and a dose reduction may be necessary. Ebazam is contraindicated in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency.Muscle weakness: Ebazam can cause muscle weakness. Ebazam is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis.Renal and hepatic impairment: In patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function, responsiveness to Ebazam and susceptibility to adverse effects are increased, and a dose reduction may be necessary. In long-term treatment, renal and hepatic function must be checked regularly.Elderly patients: In the elderly, due to the increased sensitivity to adverse reactions such as drowsiness, dizziness, muscle weakness, there is an increased risk of fall that may result in serious injury. A dose reduction is recommended.Tolerance in epilepsy: In the treatment of epilepsy with benzodiazepines- including Ebazam, consideration must be given to the possibility of a decrease in anticonvulsant efficacy (development of tolerance) in the course of treatment.CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: In patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of the active metabolite N-desmethylEbazam are expected to be increased as compared to extensive metabolizers. Dosage adjustment of Ebazam may be necessary (e.g. low starting dose with careful dose titration).Suicidality: Several epidemiological studies show an increased incidence of suicide and suicide attempt in patients with or without depression, treated with other benzodiazepines and hypnotics. There are very limited data available for Ebazam in these studies. Cases of suicidal behavior have been reported with Ebazam in post-marketing surveillance. All of these cases had confounding factors.Concomitant use of CYP2C19 inhibitors: The concomitant use of Ebazam with CYP2C19 inhibitors, including cannabidiol containing medicinal products, dietary supplements and recreational products may result in increased exposure to N-desmethylEbazam (NCLB). Such increases might lead to increased adverse effects, such as somnolence and sedation. When used with medicinal products that are CYP2C19 inhibitors dosage adjustment of Ebazam may be necessary. Dietary supplements and recreational products containing cannabidiol must not be taken in combination with Ebazam as they contain unknown quantities of cannabidiol and are of variable quality",

    "Indications": "Eburic tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Eburic tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",
    "Pharmacology": "Febuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.Hepatic impairment:\u00a0No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established",
    "Interaction": "Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Eburic on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Eburic may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Eburic with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds. Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Eburic metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Eburic. Eburic can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Eburic or naproxen being necessary. Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Eburic. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Eburic. Colchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Eburic can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Eburic. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Eburic . Antacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Eburic\u00a0 (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Eburic\u00a0 may be taken without regard to antacid use.",
    "Contraindications": "Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.",
    "Side Effects": "The most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Eburic have observed.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Gout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Eburic. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Eburic need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.Cardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Eburic than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.Liver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Eburic -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.",

    "Indications": "Eburn cream is indicated in-\n\nThe topical prophylaxis against bacterial colonization and infection in burn wounds.\nThe topical antibacterial management of certain contaminated or infection-prone wounds, other than burns.",
    "Pharmacology": "The mechanism of Silver Sulfadiazine's antibacterial action has not been fully elucidated. After exposure to the drug, structural changes in the bacterial cell membrane occur, including distortion and enlargement of the cell and a weakening of the cell wall membrane. This is accompanied by reduced viability in sensitive strains. The silver sulfadiazine molecule dissociates and the silver moiety is bound to the bacterial cells. It is believed that, after penetrating the cell wall, the silver moiety is attached to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and prevents bacterial cell proliferation. There is approximately 100 times more DNA in mammalian cells than in bacterial cells. It is thought that the ratio of silver sulfadiazine to bacterial DNA is sufficiently high to prevent bacterial division but the corresponding ratio to epithelial DNA is low enough not to block epithelial cell regeneration. The sulfadiazine moiety also provides a bacteriostatic action against sensitive organisms. In adults, up to 10% of the sulfadiazine may be absorbed and 60 to 85% of the absorbed amount is excreted in the urine. In children with 13% body surface area burns, the urinary sulfadiazine concentration was 31.8 mg/L.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The burn wounds are cleansed, and Silver Sulfadiazine is applied over the burn wound. The burn areas should be covered with Silver Sulfadiazine at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately 1/16 inches or 1.5 mm. Whenever necessary; the cream should be reapplied to any areas from which it has been removed by patient activity. If individual patient requirements make dressings necessary, they may be used. Reapplication should be ensured immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with Silver Sulfadiazine should be continued until satisfactory healing is occurred, or until the burn site is ready for grafting. The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except if a significant adverse reaction occurs.",
    "Interaction": "Enzymatic debriding agents: Eburn may inactivate enzymatic debriding agents, thus the concomitant use of these compounds may be inappropriate. Oral hypoglycemic agents and phenytoin: In patients with large area burns where serum sulfadiazine levels may approach therapeutic levels, the action of oral hypoglycemic agents and phenytoin may be potentiated and it is recommended that blood levels be monitored. Cimetidine: In-patients with large area burns, it has been reported that co-administration of Cimetidine may increase the incidence of leukopenia.",
    "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in-patients who are hypersensitive to it or any of the other ingredients in the preparation. It should not be used on pregnant women approaching or at term, on premature infants, or on newborn infants during the first 2 months of life",
    "Side Effects": "Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in-patients receiving Eburn therapy. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiform, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial nephritis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women approaching or at term. It is not known whether Silver Sulfadiazine is excreted in human milk. A decision should be made, whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: If hepatic and renal functions become impaired and elimination of drug decreases, accumulation may occur and discontinuation of this should be weighed against the therapeutic benefit being achieved. In considering the use of topical proteolytic enzymes in conjunction with it, the possibility should be noted that silver might inactivate such enzymes. Laboratory Tests: In the treatment of burn wounds involving extensive areas of the body, the serum sulfa concentrations may approach adult therapeutic levels (8 mg% to 12 mg%). Therefore, in these patients it would be advisable to monitor serum sulfa concentrations. Renal function should be carefully monitored and the urine should be checked for sulfa crystals.",

Each pack contains 1 round white tablet.0.75 mg: Each tablet contains 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel belongs to a group of medicines called progestogen. Each pack contains 2 round white tablets.",
    "Pharmacology": "Oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.",
    "Interaction": "Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interaction: Simultaneous administration of certain anticonvulsant agents (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone, carbamazepine), also other medications such as rifampicin, and griseofulvin can reduce or suppress the effectiveness of this emergency contraception.",

    "Precautions & Warnings": "Emergency contraception must be used exceptionally, since:\n\nIt does not allow to prevent a pregnancy in every instance:\nThe associated hormonal overdosing is not advisable in the case of regular intake.\nIt cannot replace regular contraception.\n\r\nAfter taking EC-Pill, the menstrual period usually occurs at the expected date nevertheless, it can occur earlier or later by a few days. After taking this medicine, it is therefore mandatory to check the absence of pregnancy by performing a pregnancy test in case of abnormal bleeding at the date of excepted menses or in case of menstrual delay of more than 5 days. The use of emergency contraception does not replace the necessary precautions against sexually transmitted diseases and the measures to be taken in case of risk of transmission. Taking this medicine is not recommended if you have had an ectopic pregnancy or if you have had salpingitis or if you have a severe digestive disease that impairs the absorption of medications.If vomiting would occur within three hours after taking this medicine, it is recommended to take immediately another EC-Pill tablet.",

Read moreAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:\u03b2 carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with \u03b2 carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
    "Pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this\u00a0tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of \u03b2 carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
    "Contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
    "Side Effects": "\u03b2 carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "\u03b2 carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "There are some evidences that \u03b2 carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases.

    "Pharmacology": "As with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Naproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals. Naproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\n\nFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\nFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\nFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\nFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\n\nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.Naproxen Suspension: Children: For juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals.

Aspirin: increase adverse effects.Diuretics: reduce the natriuretic effect of Furosemide and Thiazides.Methotrexate: enhance the toxicity of Methotrexate.Warfarin: increase the risk of GI bleeding.Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI): increase the risk of GI bleeding.",
    "Contraindications": "Naproxen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Naproxen. It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.",
    "Side Effects": "Most frequently reported side effects include following:\n\nGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\nCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\nDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\nCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\nOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Renal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term\u00a0administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal\u00a0renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria,\u00a0proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Ecless-containing products\u00a0and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Ecless and its metabolites are eliminated\u00a0primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with\u00a0significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine\u00a0clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients\u00a0with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites\u00a0has been seen in such patients.Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to\u00a0Ecless.",

    "Indications": "Ecless is indicated for the relief of sign and symptoms of-\n\nrheumatoid arthritis\nosteoarthritis\nankylosing spondylitis\njuvenile arthritis\ntendonitis\nbursitis\nacute gout\n\r\nIt is also indicated for the management of primary dysmenorrhea & pain.",
    "Pharmacology": "As with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Naproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals. Naproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\n\nFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\nFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\nFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\nFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\n\nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.Naproxen Suspension: Children: For juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals. Therapy in children under 2 years of age is not recommended. The following may be used as a guide for dosage of suspension: \n\n13 kg (29 lb) 2.5 mL b.i.d.\n25 kg (55 lb) 5 mL b.i.d.\n38 kg (84 lb) 7.5 mL b.i.d.\n\nNaproxen Gel: Is to be applied 2-6 times a day as required and is not recommended for use in children.",
    "Interaction": "ACE inhibitors: diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.Antacids & Sucralfate: delay the absorption of Ecless. Aspirin: increase adverse effects.Diuretics: reduce the natriuretic effect of Furosemide and Thiazides.Methotrexate: enhance the toxicity of Methotrexate.Warfarin: increase the risk of GI bleeding.Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI): increase the risk of GI bleeding.",
    "Contraindications": "Naproxen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Naproxen. It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.",
    "Side Effects": "Most frequently reported side effects include following:\n\nGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\nCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\nDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\nCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\nOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Renal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term\u00a0administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal\u00a0renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria,\u00a0proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Ecless-containing products\u00a0and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Ecless and its metabolites are eliminated\u00a0primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with\u00a0significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine\u00a0clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients\u00a0with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites\u00a0has been seen in such patients.Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to\u00a0Ecless.",

    "Side Effects": "As with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\nProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\nIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\nThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Eclo is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents.

    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: This cream should be applied sparingly to the skin lesion no more than 2 times daily, preferably once in the morning and once in the evening. This cream should not be applied with an occlusive dressing, or to large areas of skin on the body. The duration of treatment with this cream should continue until the inflammatory symptoms subside but not longer than 2 weeks; after 2 weeks of therapy with this cream, continue therapy as needed with a preparation containing econazole or econazole nitrate alone.Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight. Caution should be exercised.",
    "Interaction": "Econazole: compound metabolized by CYP3A4/2C9 oral anticoagulants (warfarin & acenocoumarol).Triamcinolone: lowering of plasma salicylates levels. Increased risk of Gl bleeding and ulceration with NSAIDs. Antagonised blood glucose-lowering effects of the antidiabetics. Increased risk of Hyperkalemia with amphotericin B, beta-blockers, potassium-depleting diuretics, theophylline. Increased clearance of the triamcinolone with ciclosporin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, barbiturate, rifampicin.",
    "Contraindications": "This Cream is contraindicated-\n\nIn individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.\nLike any other dermatological preparation containing corticosteroids, this Cream is contraindicated in specific skin conditions such as tuberculous, varicella, herpes simplex or other viral infections of the skin, or fresh vaccination sites.\nDecubitus ulcers: Viral, bacterial or fungal skin infections (e.g. tuberculosis of the skin, syphilis of the skin, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, chickenpox).\nRosacea and rosacea-like dermatitis.",
    "Side Effects": "Rarely, transient local mild irritation, itching & redness may occur immediately after application. Econazole has the minimal allergenic effect and is well tolerated, even by delicate skin. Adrenal suppression on long term continuous topical steroid therapy may occur, particularly in infants or children, or when occlusive dressings are applied. It should be noted that an infant's napkin may act as an occlusive dressing.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Not the Econazole but the Triamcinolone Acetonide crosses the placenta and topical administration of corticosteroids during pregnancy can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to human beings has not been established. However, topical steroids in large amounts or for prolonged periodsshould not be used in pregnancy.Lactation: Negligible amount of econazole and to some extent Triamcinolone may be excreted in small amounts in breast milk. So this cream should not be prescribed to the lactating mother or if prescribed lactation should be withheld during treatment.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "For external use only. This Cream is not for ophthalmic or oral use.\nIf a reaction suggesting hypersensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued.\nCorticosteroids applied to the skin can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects, including adrenal suppression. Systemic absorption may be increased by various factors such as application over a large skin surface area, application to damaged skin, application under occlusive skin dressings and prolonged duration of therapy.\nTopical corticosteroids are associated with skin thinning and atrophy, striae, telangiectasis and purpura.\nTopical corticosteroids may lead to increased risk of dermatological superinfection or opportunistic infection.\n\nChildren: Increased caution is required when treating children. Compared to adults, the nature of a child's skin and the larger skin surface area relative to body weight may lead to an increased absorption of the corticosteroid via the child's skin. This cream should be used in children only for short periods of time (less than 2 weeks) and on small areas (less than 10% of body surface area).Visual disturbance may be associated with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).",

Early relief of symptoms is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined. Patients with tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.",

    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: This cream should be applied sparingly to the skin lesion no more than 2 times daily, preferably once in the morning and once in the evening. This cream should not be applied with an occlusive dressing, or to large areas of skin on the body. The duration of treatment with this cream should continue until the inflammatory symptoms subside but not longer than 2 weeks; after 2 weeks of therapy with this cream, continue therapy as needed with a preparation containing econazole or econazole nitrate alone.Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight.

It should be noted that an infant's napkin may act as an occlusive dressing.",

This Cream is not for ophthalmic or oral use.\nIf a reaction suggesting hypersensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued.\nCorticosteroids applied to the skin can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects, including adrenal suppression. Systemic absorption may be increased by various factors such as application over a large skin surface area, application to damaged skin, application under occlusive skin dressings and prolonged duration of therapy.\nTopical corticosteroids are associated with skin thinning and atrophy, striae, telangiectasis and purpura.\nTopical corticosteroids may lead to increased risk of dermatological superinfection or opportunistic infection.\n\nChildren: Increased caution is required when treating children. Compared to adults, the nature of a child's skin and the larger skin surface area relative to body weight may lead to an increased absorption of the corticosteroid via the child's skin. This cream should be used in children only for short periods of time (less than 2 weeks) and on small areas (less than 10% of body surface area).Visual disturbance may be associated with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).",

    "Indications": "Ecoren is indicated for topical application-\n\nIn the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis caused by Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum canis, Microsporum audouini, Microsporum gypseum, and Epidermophyton floccosum,\nIn the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis, and in the treatment of tinea versicolor.",
    "Pharmacology": "Econazole Nitrate interferes with fungal oxidative enzymes to cause lethal accumulation of H2O2. They also reduce the formation of ergosterol, an important constituent of fungal cell wall.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Econazole vaginal tablet: One tablet should be inserted deep into the vagina at bed time for three consecutive nights. Treatment should be continued even if menstruation occurs. Although a three night course of treatment is often sufficient longer courses are advisable for women with recurrent vaginal infections.Econazole 30 gm cream: The supplied applicator should be filled with econazole cream and then inserted deep into the vagina at bedtime once or twice daily.Econazole 10 gm cream: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs.Sufficient Econazole cream should be applied to cover affected areas once daily in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and tinea versicolor, and twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with cutaneous candidiasis. Early relief of symptoms is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined. Patients with tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.",
    "Interaction": "Warfarin: Concomitant administration of econazole and warfarin has resulted in enhancement of anticoagulation effect. Most cases reported product application with use under occlusion, genital application, or application to large body surface area which may increase the systemic absorption of econzole nitrate. Monitoring of International Normalized Ratio (INR) and/or prothrombin time may be indicated especially for patients who apply econazole to large body surface areas, in the genital area, or under occlusion. Carcinogenicity Studies: Long-term animal studies to determine carcinogenic potential have not been performed.",
    "Contraindications": "Econazole is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.",
    "Side Effects": "During clinical trials, approximately 3% of patients treated with Ecoren 1% cream reported sideeffects thought possibly to be due to the drug, consisting mainly of burning, itching, stinging, and erythema. One case of a pruritic rash has also been reported.",

    "Pharmacology": "Clopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated dosesof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.",
    "Interaction": "Study of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.",
    "Contraindications": "This combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.",
    "Side Effects": "Ecosprin Plus is generally well tolerated.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Ecosprin Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Ecosprin Plus.\nReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms.

The duration of treatment with this cream should continue until the inflammatory symptoms subside but not longer than 2 weeks; after 2 weeks of therapy with this cream, continue therapy as needed with a preparation containing econazole or econazole nitrate alone.Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight. Caution should be exercised.",
    "Interaction": "Econazole: compound metabolized by CYP3A4/2C9 oral anticoagulants (warfarin & acenocoumarol).Triamcinolone: lowering of plasma salicylates levels. Increased risk of Gl bleeding and ulceration with NSAIDs. Antagonised blood glucose-lowering effects of the antidiabetics. Increased risk of Hyperkalemia with amphotericin B, beta-blockers, potassium-depleting diuretics, theophylline. Increased clearance of the triamcinolone with ciclosporin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, barbiturate, rifampicin.",
    "Contraindications": "This Cream is contraindicated-\n\nIn individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.\nLike any other dermatological preparation containing corticosteroids, this Cream is contraindicated in specific skin conditions such as tuberculous, varicella, herpes simplex or other viral infections of the skin, or fresh vaccination sites.\nDecubitus ulcers: Viral, bacterial or fungal skin infections (e.g. tuberculosis of the skin, syphilis of the skin, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, chickenpox).\nRosacea and rosacea-like dermatitis.",
    "Side Effects": "Rarely, transient local mild irritation, itching & redness may occur immediately after application. Econazole has the minimal allergenic effect and is well tolerated, even by delicate skin. Adrenal suppression on long term continuous topical steroid therapy may occur, particularly in infants or children, or when occlusive dressings are applied. It should be noted that an infant's napkin may act as an occlusive dressing.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Not the Econazole but the Triamcinolone Acetonide crosses the placenta and topical administration of corticosteroids during pregnancy can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to human beings has not been established. However, topical steroids in large amounts or for prolonged periodsshould not be used in pregnancy.Lactation: Negligible amount of econazole and to some extent Triamcinolone may be excreted in small amounts in breast milk. So this cream should not be prescribed to the lactating mother or if prescribed lactation should be withheld during treatment.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "For external use only. This Cream is not for ophthalmic or oral use.\nIf a reaction suggesting hypersensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued.\nCorticosteroids applied to the skin can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects, including adrenal suppression. Systemic absorption may be increased by various factors such as application over a large skin surface area, application to damaged skin, application under occlusive skin dressings and prolonged duration of therapy.\nTopical corticosteroids are associated with skin thinning and atrophy, striae, telangiectasis and purpura.\nTopical corticosteroids may lead to increased risk of dermatological superinfection or opportunistic infection.\n\nChildren: Increased caution is required when treating children. Compared to adults, the nature of a child's skin and the larger skin surface area relative to body weight may lead to an increased absorption of the corticosteroid via the child's skin. This cream should be used in children only for short periods of time (less than 2 weeks) and on small areas (less than 10% of body surface area).Visual disturbance may be associated with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).",

    "Indications": "Ecotin is indicated for Age-Related Eye Diseases. This is an advanced new antioxidant supplement formulated to provide nutritional support for the eye.",
    "Composition": "Each capsule contains:\n\nVitamin-C (as Ascorbic Acid BP) 60 mg\nVitamin-E (as Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate BP) 30 mg\nLutein USP 6 mg\nCopper (as Cupric Oxide BP) 2 mg\nZinc (as Zinc Oxide BP) 15 mg",
    "Pharmacology": "This is an antioxidant vitamins capsule containing Vitamin (Vitamin-C, Vitamin-E), Minerals (Zinc, Copper) and Lutein for oral administration.The formulation contains essential antioxidant vitamins, minerals and Lutein. Vitamin-C is highly concentrated in the lens compared to blood. Long term use of Vitamin-C supplement (10+ years) has been associated with reduced risk of cataract. It has important role in harmful free radicals scavenge activity. In study, it is found that high serum Vitamin-E concentrations have been associated with reduced risk of cataract (exact mechanism of action is not still established).Lutein is a carotenoid specially concentrated in macula. Clinical and animal data indicate that this carotenoid could protect the macula from oxidative or light damage. Although mechanism of action is not clear but one large study has found that high levels of dietary Lutein are associated with relatively lower risk of AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration: a condition where fine visual activity is lost).Zinc is an essential trace element involved in many enzyme systems. Symptoms of less severe deficiency include distorted or absent perception of taste, smell and poor wound healing. Severe deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhea, increased susceptibility to infection and failure to thrive in children.Copper plays an important role in growth, skeletal integrity and development of nervous system. As a part of various enzymes, it takes part of numerous metabolic conversions.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "One capsule, one or two times daily or as recommended by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "No such drug interactions have been reported.",
    "Contraindications": "This product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Consultation with the physician is recommended before use of this medication in pregnancy and lactation.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Vitamin-C should be given with care to patients with hyperoxaluria. In patients taking oral anticoagulants or Estrogen, Vitamin-E should be given carefully because it has been found to antagonize the effects ofVitamin-K leading to an increase in blood clotting time in these patients.",
