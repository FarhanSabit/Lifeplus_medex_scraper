      "name": "17 \u03b2 Estradiol",
      "generic_id": "2105",
      "Indications": "Treatment of Moderate to Severe-\n\nVasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause.\nSymptoms of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy due to Menopause.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the\u00a0 sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, 2 estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Generally, a woman without a uterus does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen.Use estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause: Estradiol 0.06% 1.25 g per day is the single approved dose for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. The lowest effective dose of Estradiol 0.06% for this indication has not been determined. Before using the canister for the first time, it must be primed. Remove the large canister cover, and fully depress the pump 5 times Discard the unused gel by thoroughly rinsing down the sink or placing it in the household trash. After priming, the pump is ready to use. The recommended area of application is the arm. Apply a thin layer over the entire arm on the inside and outside from wrist to shoulder.Treatment of Moderate to Severe Symptoms of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy due to Menopause: Estradiol 0.06% 1.25 g per day is the single approved dose for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. The lowest effective dose of Estradiol 0.06% for this indication has not been determined. When prescribing solely for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, first consider the use of topical vaginal products. Before using the canister for the first time, it must be primed. Remove the large canister cover, and fully depress the pump 5 times. Discard the unused gel by thoroughly rinsing down the sink or placing it in the household trash. After priming, the pump is ready to use. The recommended area of application is the arm. Apply a thin layer over the entire arm on the inside and outside from wrist to shoulder.",
      "Interaction": "In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4, such as St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin, may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogen and may result in adverse reactions.",
      "Contraindications": "Estradiol is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions:\n\nUndiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding\nBreast cancer or a history of breast cancer\nEstrogen-dependent neoplasia\nActive DVT, PE, or history of these conditions\nActive arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke or MI), or a history of these conditions\nKnown anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, or hypersensitivity to Estradiol\nHepatic impairment or disease\nProtein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency, or other known thrombophilic disorders",
      "Side Effects": "Not available",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Estradiol is not indicated for use in pregnancy. There are no data with the use of EstroGel in pregnant women, however, epidemiologic studies and meta-analysis have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalities and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives (estrogens and progestins) before conception or during early pregnancy.Estrogens are present in human milk and can reduce milk production in breast-feeding women. This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast- feeding is well established. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for EstroGel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from EstroGel or from the underlying maternal condition.",

      "Pharmacology": "Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Abemaciclib tablets are taken orally with or without food.\n\nRecommended starting dose in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor: 150 mg twice daily.\nRecommended starting dose as monotherapy: 200 mg twice daily.\nDosing interruption and/or dose reductions may be required based on individual safety and tolerability.",

      "Indications": "Abiraterone Acetate is a CYP17 inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with\n\nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).\nMetastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Abiraterone Acetate is converted in vivo to Abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 \u03b1-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions:1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 \u03b1-hydroxy derivatives by 17 \u03b1-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended Dose For Metastatic CRPC: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Recommended Dose For Metastatic High-Risk CSPC: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg administered orally once daily. Patients receiving Abiraterone Acetate should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone Acetate must be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or at least two hours atier a meal. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Do not crush or chew tablets.Dose Modification:\n\nFor patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the Abiraterone Acetate starting dose to 250 mg once daily.\nFor patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold Abiraterone Acetate until recovery. Retreatment may be initated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone Acetate should be discontinued if patients develop severe hepatotoxicity.\nAvoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Phenobarbital) during Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued. Or, as directed by the registered physician.\n\nPediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",
      "Interaction": "Drugs That Inhibit Or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes: Based on in vitro data, Abiraterone Acetate is a substrate of CYP3A4. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of Abiraterone by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of Abiraterone.Effects Of Abiraterone On Drug Metabolizing Enzymes: Abiraterone Acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of Dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when Dextromethorphan was given with Abiraterone Acetate 1,000 mg daily and Prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of Abiraterone Acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., Thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of Pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when Pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg Abiraterone Acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with Abiraterone Acetate.",

BTK is a signaling molecule of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. In nonclinical studies, acalabrutinib inhibited BTK-mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69 and inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenograft models.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of Acalabrutinib is 100 mg taken orally approximately every twelve hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Advise patients to swallow capsule whole with water. Advise patients not to open, break or chew the capsules. Acalabrutinib may be taken with or without food. If a dose of Acalabrutinib is missed by more than 3 hours, it should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at its regularly scheduled time. Extra capsules of Acalabrutinib should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.Recommended Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions: Dosage of Acalabrutinib can be reduced up to 100 mg daily for the toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level. If the adverse reaction occurrence more than four times Acalabrutinib can be Discontinue.",
      "Interaction": "Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Acalabrutinib: Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (200 mg Iitraconazole once daily for 5 days) increased the Acalabrutinib Cmax by 3.9-fold and AUC by 5.1-fold in healthy subjects. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations with Acalabrutinib and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem) showed that co-administration increased Acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC increased by 2- to almost 3-fold.Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Acalabrutinib: Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer (600 mg rifampin once daily for 9 days) decreased Acalabrutinib Cmax by 68% and AUC by 77% in healthy subjects.Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: Acalabrutinib solubility decreases with increasing pH. Co-administration with an antacid (1 g calcium carbonate) decreased Acalabrutinib AUC by 53% in healthy subjects. Co-administration with a proton pump inhibitor (40 mg omeprazole for 5 days) decreased Acalabrutinib AUC by 43%.In Vitro Studies-Metabolic Pathways: Acalabrutinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, but does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. The active metabolite (ACP-5862) is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, but does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5. Acalabrutinib is a weak inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4; the active metabolite (ACP-5862) weakly induces CYP3A4. Based on in vitro data and PBPK modeling, no interaction with CYP substrates is expected at clinically relevant concentrations.Drug Transporter Systems: Acalabrutinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. Acalabrutinib is not a substrate of renal uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2, or hepatic transporters OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Acalabrutinib does not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations.

      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Based on findings in animals, Acalabrutinib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of Acalabrutinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in reduced fetal growth at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times exposures in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Lactation: No data are available regarding the presence of Acalabrutinib or its active metabolite in human milk, its effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats. Due to the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from Acalabrutinib, advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking Acalabrutinib and for at least 2 weeks after the final dose.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Hemorrhage: Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have occurred in the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acalabrutinib monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events, including gastrointestinal, intracranial, and epistaxis have been reported in 2% of patients. Overall, bleeding events including bruising and petechiae of any grade occurred in approximately 50% of patients with hematological malignancies. The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. Acalabrutinib may further increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies and patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding Acalabrutinib for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.Infection: Serious infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), including fatal events and opportunistic infections have occurred in the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acalabrutinib monotherapy. Consider prophylaxis in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 18% of these patients. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 infection was pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and progressive multifocaln leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate. Cytopenias: In the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies, patients treated with Acalabrutinib monotherapy experienced Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (23%), anemia (11%) and thrombocytopenia (8%) based on laboratory measurements.

      "generic_id": "27",
      "Indications": "Acarbose is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2\u00a0diabetes mellitus.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose\u00a0does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose\u00a0to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose\u00a0diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dosage of Acarbose\u00a0is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d. Maintenance Dosage Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of Acarbose\u00a0should be adjusted at 4\u20138 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.",
      "Interaction": "Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Acarbose, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving Acarbose\u00a0in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia.Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Acarbose\u00a0given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made. Very rarely, individual cases of hypoglycemic shock have been reported in patients receiving Acarbose\u00a0therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.",
      "Contraindications": "Acarbose\u00a0is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis. Acarbose\u00a0is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction. In addition, Acarbose\u00a0is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.",
      "Side Effects": "Diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, constipation, or stomach pain may occur in the first few weeks of treatment as your body adjusts to this medication but usually improve with time. Follow your prescribed diet to help lessen these side effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. The safety of Acarbose\u00a0in pregnant women has not been established. A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Acarbose\u00a0should not be administered to a nursing woman.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Because of its mechanism of action, Acarbose when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Because Acarbose given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when Acarbose was added to metformin therapy.Oral glucose (dextrose), whose\u00a0absorption\u00a0is not inhibited by Acarbose, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and\u00a0fructose\u00a0is inhibited by Acarbose, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either\u00a0intravenous\u00a0glucose infusion or glucagon injection.",

These include regulation of RNA/DNA synthesis, modulation of factors which influence epidermal proliferation, modification of glycoprotein synthesis and modulation of the immune response. Whatever the exact mechanism of action, the most prominent effect of acitretin is a modulation of cellular differentiation in the epidermis which re-establishes a more normal pattern of cell growth.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and elderly: Initial daily dose should be 25 mg or 30 mg for 2 to 4 weeks. After this initial treatment period the involved areas of the skin should show a marked response and/or side-effects should be apparent.

However, it may be necessary in some cases to increase the dose up to a maximum of 75 mg/day.In patients with Darier\u2019s disease a starting dose of 10 mg may be appropriate. The dose should be increased cautiously as isomorphic reactions may occur. Patients with severe congenital ichthyosis and severe Darier\u2019s disease may require therapy beyond 3 months. The lowest effective dosage, not exceeding 50mg/day, should be given. Continuous use beyond 6 months is contra-indicated as only limited clinical data are available on patients treated beyond this length of time.Children: The daily dosage is about 0.5mg/kg. Higher doses (up to 1mg/kg daily) may be necessary in some cases for limited periods, but only up to a maximum of 35 mg/day.",
      "Interaction": "Existing data suggests that concurrent intake of acitretin with ethanol led to the formation of etretinate. Concomitant administration of methotrexate, tetracyclines or vitamin A and other retinoids with acitretin is contraindicated. In concurrent treatment with phenytoin, it must be remembered that Acitretin partially reduces the protein binding of phenytoin. Low dose progesterone-only products (minipills) may be an inadequate method of contraception during acitretin therapy, Investigations into the effect of acitretin on the protein binding of anticoagulants of the coumarin type (warfarin) revealed no interaction.",
      "Contraindications": "Acitretin is highly teratogenic and must not be used by women who are pregnant. The same applies to women of childbearing potential unless strict contraception is practiced 4 weeks before, during and for 2 years after treatment. The use of Acitretin is contra-indicated in women who are breast feeding.Acitretin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment and in patients with chronic abnormally elevated blood lipid values. Concomitant administration of Acitretin with other retinoids or Vitamin A is contra-indicated due to the risk of hypervitaminosis A. Acitretin is contra-indicated in cases of hypersensitivity to the preparation (acitretin or excipients) or to other retinoids. Patients with rare glucose-galactosemalabsorption should not take this medicine.",
      "Side Effects": "Adverse effects are seen in most patients receiving acitretin. Most of the clinical side-effects of Acitretin are dose-related and are usually well-tolerated at the recommended dosages. However, the toxic dose of Acitretin is close to the therapeutic dose and most patients experience some side-effects during theinitial period whilst dosage is being adjusted. The skin and mucous membranes are most commonly affected. An initial worsening of psoriasis symptoms issometimes seen at the beginning of the treatment period.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Acitretin is contraindicated in pregnant women or nursing mother. It is highly teratogenic. Its use is contraindicated in women who might become pregnant during or within 2 years of the cessation of treatment.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "The risk of giving birth to a deformed child is exceptionally high if Acitretin is taken before or during pregnancy, no matter for how long or at what dosage. Women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with acitretin. Donation of blood by a patient being treated with acitretin is prohibited during and for two years after completion of treatment with acitretin. The effects of UV light are enhanced by retinoid therapy; therefore patients should avoid excessive exposure to sunlight. Hepatic function should be checked before starting treatment with Acitretin, every 1-2 weeks for the first 2 months after commencement and then every 3 months during treatment. Serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides (fasting values) must be monitored before starting treatment, one month after the commencement and then every 3 months during treatment, especially in high-risk patients and during long-term treatment. Retinoids can alter glucose tolerance, blood sugar levels should therefore be checked. Patients should be warned of the possibility of alopecia. Decreased night vision has been reported with acitretin therapy. Patients with severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances should discontinue acitretin immediately.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Aclidinium bromide: Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.Formoterol fumarate: Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) (beta 2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Aciclovir is a synthetic purine derivative. Aciclovir exerts its antiviral effect on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Varicella-zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Aciclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Aciclovir Triphosphate. Aciclovir is converted to Aciclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase; the monophosphate is phosphorylated to the diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via another cellular enzyme to the triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug. 15-30% of an oral dose of the drug is absorbed from Gl tract. Peak plasma concentrations usually occur within 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. It is widely distributed into body tissues and fluids including the brain, saliva, lungs, liver, muscle, spleen, uterus, vaginal mucosa and secretions, CSF, and herpetic vesicular fluid. Aciclovir is excreted through the kidney by the glomerular filtration & tubular secretion.",

Read moreAdjunctive use in the management of cardiac arrest. It is used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Intracardiac puncture and intramyocardial injection of adrenaline may be effective when external cardiac compression and attempts to restore the circulation by electrical defibrillation or use of a pacemaker fail. Adrenaline is a drug that leads to increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased air entry, increased blood glucose, stimulates cardiac activity and reduces allergic reactions by reducing inflammatory response caused by histamine. Due to these properties, it is used for the treatment of allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Adrenaline is the favored treatment for anaphylactic shock and should be administered immediately if a person begins exhibiting severe allergic reactions. Adrenaline is also used in life threatening asthma when failing ventilation and continued deterioration despite nebulizer therapy.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "The actions of epinephrine resemble the effects of stimulation of adrenergic nerves. It acts on both alpha and beta receptor sites of sympathetic effector cells. Its most prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle. When given by rapid intravenous injection, it produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic, by (1) direct stimulation of cardiac muscle which increases the strength of ventricular contraction, (2) increasing the heart rate and (3) constriction of the arterioles in the skin, mucosa and splanchnic areas of the circulation.When given by slow intravenous injection, epinephrine usually produces only a moderate rise in systolic and a fall in diastolic pressure. Although some increase in pulse pressure occurs, there is usually no great elevation in mean blood pressure. Accordingly, the compensatory reflex mechanisms that come into play with a pronounced increase in blood pressure do not antagonize the direct cardiac actions of epinephrine as much as with catecholamines that have a predominant action on alpha receptors.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Cardiac arrest:\n\nIntravenous injection: 1 mg injection repeated every 2-3 minutes as necessary.\nEndotracheal: 2-3 mg via an endotracheal tube, repeated as necessary.\nIntracardiac: 0.1 to 1 mg, direct into the atrium of the heart.\nIntraspinal: Usual dose is 0.2 to 0.4 mg added to anesthetic spinal fluid mixture (to prolong anesthetic action by limiting absorption).\n\r\nAnaphylaxis, asthma or severe bronchospasm:\n\nAdult dose is 0.25 0.5 mg. It may be repeated at 5 minutes intervals until perfusion and respiratory status normalizes.\nIn case of dose dilution: 1 mg of Adrenaline to be diluted in 9 ml Normal Saline.\n\nChildren: Initially 10 mcg/kg body weight, not to exceed 250 mcg. May be repeated every 3-5 minutes if necessary. Subsequent doses should be 100 mcg/kg.",
      "Interaction": "Use of Adrenaline with excessive doses of digitalis, mercurial diuretics or other drugs that sensitize the heart to arrhythmias is not recommended. The adverse effects of Adrenaline may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants; certain antihistamines; e.g, Diphenhydramine, Tripelennamine, Chlorpheniramine and L-thyroxine Sodium.",
      "Contraindications": "Hypertension, arteriosclerosis, coronary disease and hyperthyroidism. Not to be given to patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.",
      "Side Effects": "Common side effects are anxiety, restlessness, dizziness, headache, palpitations, rapid pulse, tremors, weakness and coldness of the extremities may be reported even with small doses and especially when given in conjunction with local anaesthetics.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. It crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Adrenaline should only be used in pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. It is excreted in breast milk and therefore Adrenaline is not recommended for use during lactation because of the risk of adverse effects of infants.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "The solution should not be used if it is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate.

The toxoid is purified by chemical methods and is adsorbed onto aluminium phosphate as adjuvant. Thiomersal is added as preservative. The vaccine has the appearance of a greyish-white suspension and does not contain any horse serum protein. Therefore it does not induce sensitization to sera of equine origin. The vaccine meets the requirements of WHO, when tested by the methods outlined in WHO, TRS. (1990), 800.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The full basic course of immunization against tetanus consists of two primary doses of 0.5 ml at least four weeks apart, followed by the third dose 6-12 months later. To maintain a high level of immunity further 0.5 ml. booster doses are recommended at every feasible interval (for adults usually 5 to 10 years).Protection of the Newborn against Tetanus: For prevention of neonatal tetanus, Tetanus Toxoid vaccine is recommended for immunization of women of childbearing age, and especially pregnant women. Tetanus Toxoid vaccine may be safely administered during pregnancy and should be given to the mother at first contact or as early as possible in pregnancy. A five dose schedule is recommended for previously unimmunized women of childbearing age: after the basic course of immunization with three doses, two additional booster doses should be given, at least one year after the previous dose or during the subsequent pregnancy.Vaccination of Injured Person: For those subjects who have proof of either completing their course of primary immunizations containing tetanus toxoid or receiving a booster shot within the previous 5 years no additional dose of tetanus toxoid is recommended. If more than 5 years have elapsed, and infection with tetanus because of injury or other cause is suspected, 0.5ml of the Tetanus Toxoid vaccine should be given immediately. Where the immunization history is inadequate 1500 IU (3000 old AU) tetanus antiserum and 0.5 ml Tetanus Toxoid vaccine should be injected, with separate syringes, to different body sites. (If available, 250 units of tetanus immune globulin (human origin) can be substituted for the tetanus antiserum). A second 0.5ml dose of Tetanus Toxoid vaccine is recommended after 2 weeks and a third dose after a further 1 month.A note of caution: if horse-origin tetanus antiserum is used in prophylaxis, the patient should be tested for sensitivity to horse serum protein prior to its administration. It is desirable to have 1 ml of Adrenaline solution (1:1000) immediately available and the normal precautions followed when injecting antitoxins.Method of Inoculation: This should be injected intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle in women and older children. Only sterile needles and syringes should be used for each injection. The vaccine should be well shaken before use. Once opened, multi-dose vials should be kept between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C.Reactions: Reactions are generally mild and confined to the site of injection. Some inflammation may occur together with transient fever, malaise and irritability. Occasionally a nodule may develop at the site of injection but this is rare. An increased severity of reactions to vaccination may be observed in subjects. Who have had many booster immunizations.",
      "Interaction": "If passive immunization for tetanus is needed, TIG (Human) is the product of choice. It provides longer protection than antitoxin of animal origin and causes few adverse reactions. As with other intramuscular injections, use with caution in-patients on anticoagulant therapy. Immunosuppressive therapies may reduce the immune response to vaccines.",
      "Contraindications": "The vaccine should not be given to persons who showed a severe reaction to a previous dose of tetanus toxoid. Immunization should be deferred during the course of any febrile illness or acute infection. A minor febrile illness such as a mild upper respiratory infection should not preclude immunization.",
      "Side Effects": "Adsorbed tetanus vaccine is generally well tolerated. Most recipients of tetanus vaccine experience some reactions upon vaccination. These are generally moderate and short in duration. They mainly consist of local reactions at the injection site (erythema, induration and tenderness). Systemic reactions (malaise and elevated temperature) are reported less commonly.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "For protection of neonatal tetanus, tetanus toxoid is recommended for immunization of women of childbearing age and especially pregnant women. Tetanus toxoid may be safely administered during pregnancy and should be given to the mother at first contact or as early as possible. It is not known if tetanus toxoid is excreted in human milk. It may be administered to nursing mothers only if clearly needed.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "For treatment of severe anaphylaxis the initial dose of adrenaline is 0.1-0.5 mg (0.1-0.5 ml of 1:1000 injections) given s/c or i/m. Single dose should not exceed 1 mg (1ml). For infants and children, the recommended dose of adrenaline is 0.01mg/kg (0.01ml/kg of 1:1000 injection). Single paediatric dose should not exceed 0.5 mg (0.5ml). The mainstay in the treatment of severe anaphylaxis is the prompt use of adrenaline, which can be lifesaving. It should be used at the first suspicion of anaphylaxis.As with the use of all vaccines the vaccinees should remain under observation for not less than 30 minutes for possibility of occurrence of immediate or early allergic reactions. Hydrocortisone Sodium Succinate and antihistaminics should also be available in addition to supportive measures such as oxygen inhalation.There is an increased incidence of local and systemic reactions to booster doses of Tetanus Toxoid when given to previously immunized persons. Special care should be taken to ensure that the injection does not enter a blood vessel.It is extremely important when the parent, guardian, or adult patient returns for the next dose in the series, the parent, guardian, or adult patient should be questioned concerning occurrence of any symptoms and/or signs of an adverse reaction after the previous dose.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Afatinib covalently binds to the kinase domains of EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4) and irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, resulting in downregulation of ErbB signaling. Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions.Afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2.Treatment with afatinib resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice implanted with tumors either overexpressing wild type EGFR or HER2 or in an EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant model.",

Agomelatine resynchronises circadian rhythms in animal models of circadian rhythm disruption. Agomelatine increases noradrenaline and dopamine release specifically in the frontal cortex and has no influence on the extracellular levels of serotonin.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The effective dose of agomelatine is 25 mg per day given once at bed time for two weeks and can be increased to 50 mg per day in patients with inadequate response. Night time dosing is recommended because agomelatine improves the quality of sleep without day time sedation. For oral administration with or without food. Most adult patients should take a dosage of 25 mg (one tablet) daily. It is usually taking prior to bed time.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "The main function of albumin results from its contribution to plasma colloid oncotic pressure and transport function. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and carries hormones, enzymes, medicines, and toxins. Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, in addition to maintenance capillary membrane integrity. Exogenously administered albumin increases the oncotic pressure of the intravascular system, moving fluids from the interstitial space, thereby decreasing edema and increasing the circulating blood volume. The increase in volume reduces the concentration and viscosity of blood in patients with decreased circulating blood volume while maintaining cardiac output in shock. In dehydrated patients, negligible effects exist on circulating blood volume. In addition to the above albumin replaces protein in patients with hypoproteinemia until the cause of the deficiency can be determined.This drug has thousands of endogenous and exogenous targets. Human albumin also binds and carries a plethora of hydrophobic molecules, such as endogenous (i.e., cholesterol, fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroxine) or exogenous substances (for example, drugs and toxins), transition metal ions, as well as gas (nitric oxide [NO]), with resulting implications for their solubilisation, transport, metabolism, and detoxification.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Human albumin 25% is for intravenous administration only. Human albumin may be diluted with 5% glucose or 0.9% sodium chloride. Concentration, dosage, and infusion-rate should be adjusted to the patient\u2019s individual requirements and indication.\n\nHypovolemia: Initial dose 25 g is suggested.\nHypoalbuminemia: 50-75 gm\nPrevention of central volume fluid removed depletion after\nparacentesis due to cirrhotic ascites: 6-8 gm for every 1000 mL of ascitic.\nOHSS: 50 to 100 gm over 4 hours and repeated at 4-12 hour intervals as necessary. 10-50 gm; single infusion.\nARDS: 25 g over 30 minutes and repeated at 8 hours for 3 days if necessary.\nBurns: Determined by direct observation of vital sign or measurement of either plasma oncotic pressure or protein content.\n\nHuman albumin 20%: Measures of adequacy of circulating volume and not plasma albumin levels should be used to determine the dose required. If human albumin is to be administered, haemodynamic performance should be monitored regularly; this may include:\n\narterial blood pressure and pulse rate\ncentral venous pressure\npulmonary artery wedge pressure\nurine output\nelectrolyte\nhaematocrit / haemoglobin\n\r\nThe solution can be directly administered by the intravenous route, or it can be diluted in an isotonic solution (e.g. 0.9% sodium chloride). In plasma exchange the infusion rate should be adjusted to the rate of removal.Human albumin 5%\u00a0may be given intravenously without further dilution. This concentration is approximately isotonic and iso-osmotic with citrated plasma. Albumin (Human) in this concentration provides additional fluid for plasma volume expansion. Therefore, when it is administered to patients with normal blood volume, the rate of infusion should be slow enough to prevent too rapid expansion of plasma volume.In the treatment of shock in an adult patient an initial dose of 500 mL of the 5% albumin solution is given as rapidly as tolerated. If response within 30 minutes is inadequate, an additional 500 mL of 5% albumin solution may be given. The 50 mL dosage form would be appropriate for pediatric use, with a dose of 10-20 mL per kg of body weight infused intravenously at a rate up to 5-10 mL per minute. Therapy should be guided by the clinical response, blood pressure and an assessment of relative anemia. If more than 1000 mL are given, or if hemorrhage has occurred, the administration of packed red blood cells may be desirable.In severe burns, immediate therapy should include large volumes of crystalloid with lesser amounts of 5% albumin solution to maintain an adequate plasma volume. After the first 24 hours, the ratio of albumin to crystalloid may be increased to establish and maintain a plasma albumin level of about 2.5 g/100 mL or a total serum protein level of about 5.2 g/100 mL. However, an optimal regimen for the use of colloids, electrolytes and water after severe burns has not been established.The infusion of Albumin (Human) as a nutrient in the treatment of chronic hypoproteinemia is not recommended. In acute hypoproteinemia, 5% albumin may be used in replacing the protein lost in hypoproteinemic conditions. However, if edema is present or if large amounts of albumin are lost, Albumin (Human) 25% is preferred because of the greater amount of protein in the concentrated solution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",

Alectinib demonstratedin vitroand in vivoactivity against mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including mutations responsible forresistance to crizotinib.The major metabolite of alectinib (M4) has shown similar in vitropotency and activity. Based on nonclinicaldata, alectinib is not a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which are both efflux transporters in the blood brain barrier, and is therefore able to distribute into and be retained within the central nervous system.

Patients with underlying severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) should receive a starting dose of 450 mg taken twice daily with food (total daily dose of 900 mg).Duration of treatment: Treatment with Alectinib should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Delayed or missed doses: If a planned dose of Alectinib is missed, patients can make up that dose unless the next dose is due within 6 hours. Patients should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. If vomiting occurs after taking a dose of Alectinib , patients should take the next dose at the scheduled time.Dose adjustments: Management of adverse events may require dose reduction, temporary interruption, or discontinuation of treatment with Alectinib. The dose of Alectinib should be reduced in steps of 150 mg twice daily based on tolerability. Alectinib treatment should be permanently discontinued if patients are unable to tolerate the 300 mg twice daily dose.Method of administration: Alectinib is for oral use. The hard capsules should be swallowed whole, and must not be opened or dissolved. They must be taken with food.",
      "Interaction": "Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme mediating the metabolism of both Alectinib and its major active metabolite M4, and CYP3A contributes to 40% - 50% of total hepatic metabolism. M4 has shown similar in vitro potency and activity against ALK.CYP3A inducers: Co-administration of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampicin once daily, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single oral dose of 600 mg Alectinib reduced Alectinib Cmax, and AUCinf by 51% and 73% respectively and increased M4 Cmax and AUCinf 2.20 and 1.79-fold respectively. The effect on the combined exposure of Alectinib and M4 was minor, reducing Cmax and AUCinf by 4% and 18%, respectively. Based on the effects on the combined exposure of Alectinib and M4, no dose adjustments are required when Alectinib is co-administered with CYP3A inducers. Appropriate monitoring is recommended for patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of multiple oral doses of 400 mg posaconazole twice daily, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with a single oral dose of 300 mg Alectinib increased Alectinib exposure Cmax and AUCinf by 1.18 and 1.75-fold respectively, and reduced M4 Cmax and AUCinf by 71% and 25% respectively. The effect on the combined exposure of Alectinib and M4 was minor, reducing Cmax by 7% and increasing AUCinf 1.36-fold. Based on the effects on the combined exposure of Alectinib and M4, no dose adjustments are required when Alectinib is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors. Appropriate monitoring is recommended for patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole nefazodone, grapefruit or Seville oranges).Medicinal products that increase gastric pH: Multiple doses of esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, 40 mg once daily, demonstrated no clinically relevant effect on the combined exposure of Alectinib and M4. Therefore, no dose adjustments are required when Alectinib is co-administered with proton pump inhibitors or other medicinal products which raise gastric pH (e.g. H2 receptor antagonists or antacids).Effect of transporters on Alectinib disposition: M4 is a substrate of P-gp. As Alectinib inhibits P-gp, it is not expected that co-medication with P-gp inhibitors has a relevant effect on M4 exposure.",

The majority of these events occurred during the first 3months of treatment. In the pivotal Alectinib clinical trials it was reported that three patients with Grade 3\u20124 AST/ALT elevations had drug-induced liver injury. Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to three times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than or equal to two times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in 1 patient treated in Alectinib clinical trials.Bradycardia: Symptomatic bradycardia can occur with Alectinib. Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored as clinically indicated. Dose modification is not required in case of asymptomatic bradycardia. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia or life-threatening events, concomitant medicinal products known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive medicinal products should be evaluated and Alectinib treatment should be adjusted.Photosensitivity: Photosensitivity to sunlight has been reported with Alectinib administration.

      "Pharmacology": "Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover.Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H] alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H] alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Alendronate Sodium is a bisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Alendronate is effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. It transiently distributes to soft tissues following administration but is then rapidly distributed to bone or excreted in the urine. Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%. There is no evidence that Alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans. At the cellular level, Alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specially under osteoclasts. It inhibits osteoclast activity. In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption, leading to progressive gains in bone mass. Vitamin D is required for normal bone formation. Vitamin D insufficiency develops when both sunlight exposure and dietary intake are inadequate. Insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, increased parathyroid hormone levels, bone loss, and increased risk of skeletal fracture.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
      "Interaction": "Calcium supplement, antacids and some oral medications will interfere with absorption of Alendronate if taken at the same time. Intravenous ranitidine makes the bioavailability of oral Alendronate double. Incidence of upper gastro-intestinal adverse events associated with NSAID and aspirin appears to be greater with concomitant administration of Alendronate. Mineral oils, orlistat, and bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D. Anticonvulsants, cimetidine, and thiazides may increase the catabolism of vitamin D.",

Side effects include esophageal reactions, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhoea or constipation, flatulence, musculoskeletal pain, headache, rash, erythema and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category C. Overdoses of vitamin D have shown teratogenic effects in pregnant animals. Alendronic Acid & Vitamin D3 (Colecalciferol) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Cholecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk. It is not known whether alendronate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when administered to lactating women.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Hypocalcaemia and other disturbances of mineral metabolism should be corrected before initiation of therapy. Alendronate can cause local irritation of the upper gastro-intestinal mucosa. Caution should be used when Alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems such as dysphagia, esophageal disease, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "The first step involved in the activation of vitamin D3 is a 25-hydroxylation which is catalysed by the 25-hydroxylase in the liver and then by other enzymes. The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyses the first reaction in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. The active form of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by: increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, increasing osteoclastic resorption, and increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein.",

      "Pharmacology": "Alfuzosin Hydrochloride is a selective antagonist of post-synaptic a1 adrenoreceptors, which are located in the prostate, bladder base, bladder neck, prostatic capsule, and prostatic urethra. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride relaxes the tone of the prostate smooth muscle, prostate capsule, bladder neck and proximal urethra. It competitively and selectively binds to the post synaptic a1-adrenergic receptors in the lower urinary tract. It also relaxes sympathetic nervous stimulation, reduces resting urethral pressure and inhibits urethral hypertonia-induced sympathetic nervous stimulation. As an uroselective agent, Alfuzosin Hydrochloride preferentially binds to prostatic a1 receptors, blockage of these receptors result in reduction of BPH symptoms, improvement of urine flow and decreased potential for hypertensive events.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
      "Interaction": "Combinations contra-indicated: Alpha-1-receptor blockers. Combinations to be taken into account: Antihypertensive drugs, nitrates, potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole and ritonavir. Repeated 200mg daily dosing of ketoconazole, for seven days resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in Cmax and a 2.5-fold increase in exposure of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg when administered as a single dose under fed conditions (high fat meal). Other parameters such as tmax and t1/2 were not modified. Cmax and AUC of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg, when administered as a single dose under fed conditions, increased 2.3- fold and 3.0- fold, respectively following 8-day repeated 400mg ketoconazole daily dosing. The administration of general anaesthetics to patients receiving Alfuzosin Hydrochloride could cause profound hypotension. It is recommended that the tablets be withdrawn 24 hours before surgery.Other forms of interaction:\u00a0No pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed in healthy volunteers between Alfuzosin Hydrochloride and the following drugs: warfarin, digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol.",
      "Contraindications": "As with all alpha-1-blockers in some subjects, in particular patients receiving antihypertensive medications or nitrates, postural hypotension with or without symptoms (dizziness, fatigue, sweating) may develop within a few hours following administration. In such cases, the patient should lie down until the symptoms have completely disappeared. These effects are transient, occur at the beginning of treatment and do not usually prevent the continuation of treatment. The patient should be warned of the possible occurrence of such events. As with all alpha1-receptor blockers, Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with acute cardiac failure. Care should be taken when Alfuzosin Hydrochloride is administered to patients who have had a pronounced hypotensive response to another alpha-1-blocker. Treatment should be initiated gradually in patients with hypersensitivity to alpha-1-blockers. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be administered carefully to patients being treated with antihypertensives. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. Patients with congenital QTc prolongation, with a known history of acquired QTc prolongation or who are taking drugs known to increase the QTc interval should be evaluated before and during the administration of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride. In coronary patients, the specific treatment for coronary insufficiency should be continued. If angina pectoris reappears or worsens Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be discontinued.\u00a0 As there are no clinical safety data available in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30ml/min), Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg prolonged released tablets should not be administered to this patient group. Patients should be warned that the tablet should be swallowed whole. Any other mode of administration, such as crunching, crushing, chewing, grinding or pounding to powder should be prohibited. These actions may lead to inappropriate release and absorption of the drug and therefore possible early adverse reactions. The \u2018Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome\u2019 (IFIS, a variant of small pupil syndrome) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha-1-blockers. Although the risk of this event with Alfuzosin Hydrochloride appears very low, ophthalmic surgeons should be informed in advance of cataract surgery of current or past use of alpha-1-blockers, as IFIS may lead to increased procedural complications. The ophthalmologists should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg prolonged release tablets contain hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is administered orally. It acts on purine catabolism without disrupting the biosynthesis of purines. It reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting the biochemical reactions immediately preceding its formation. Allopurinol is a structural analogue of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine. It is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism. Allopurinol is approximately 90% absorbed from the GI tract. Peak plasma levels generally occur at 1.5 hours to 4.5 hours. It has a plasma half life of about 1 to 2 hours. Approximately 20% of the ingested Allopurinol is excreted in the faeces.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: Allopurinol should be introduced at low dosage e.g. 100 mg/day to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and increased only if the serum urate response is unsatisfactory. Extra caution should be exercised if renal function is poor.

Use in children is rarely indicated, except in malignant conditions (especially leukaemia) and certain enzyme disorders such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.Elderly: In the absence of specific data, the lowest dosage which produces satisfactory urate reduction should be used.Dosage in renal impairment: In severe renal insufficiency, it may be advisable to use less than 100 mg per day or to use single doses of 100mg\u00a0at longer intervals than one day.",
      "Interaction": "When 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine is given concurrently with Allopurinol, only one-quarter of the usual dose of 6- mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be given because inhibition of xanthine oxidase will prolong their activity. Evidence suggests that the plasma half-life of vidarabine is increased in the presence of allopurinol. When the two products are used concomitantly extra vigilance is necessary, to recognise enhanced toxic effects. Theophylline levels should be monitored in patients starting or increasing allopurinol therapy. An increase in frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.

To obtain a full secretory endometrium in oestrogen-primed castrated women or to postpone menstruation (with an oestrogen added) in normal ovulating women, doses of allylestrenol were required which were higher than those recommended for the treatment/prevention of abortion.In vitro studies have shown that allylestrenol stimulates the synthesis of progesterone in the human placenta. It also brought about a significant (p/. 0,01) increase in the production of some specific placental enzymes (cystine aminopeptidase and heat-stable alkaline phosphatase).Histological and histochemical changes indicating an increased activity have been found in the placenta, particularly in the syncytiotrophoblast of women with a normal and threatened pregnancy, treated with allylestrenol. The stimulatory effect of allylestrenol on placental function was also suggested by the increased level of placental hormones (pregnanediol, oestriol, HCG and HPL) and enzymes (oxytocinase, CAP) in the maternal urine and plasma, which followed the administration of the drug e.g. in the early weeks as well as in the last trimester of pregnancy.A study in full-term pregnant women revealed that allylestrenol in high doses (up to 100 mg daily) did suppress the intensity of spontaneous uterine contractions, but had no effect on the sensitivity of the uterine muscle to oxytocin, and no adverse effect on the progress of normal delivery.Studies in non-pregnant women with and without endocrinological disorders have shown that allylestrenol has no oestrogenic or androgenic properties and no adverse effects on the adrenal function.No abnormal liver function tests or water and salt retention were observed in healthy female volunteers (non pregnant) who were given allylestrenol.",

      "Pharmacology": "Aloe vera is a succulent plant with thick, fleshy, serrated, lanceolate-shaped leaves of green-greyish color. Aloe vera inner gel is obtained from the lower leaves of the plant by slicing the leaf open. The gel is clear, odorless and tasteless and is free of leaf skin or yellow parts. More than 75 active ingredients from inner gel of aloe vera have been identified including vitamins, minerals, enzymes, sugars, anthraquinones or phenolic compounds, lignin, saponins, sterols, amino acids and salicylic acid.Different mechanisms have been proposed for the wound-healing effects of aloe vera gel, which include keeping the wound moist, increasing epithelial cell migration, rapid maturation of collagen and reduction in inflammation.Mucopolysaccharides of aloe vera helps in binding moisture into the skin. It has been identified that the aloe vera gel containing items improves skin hydration by means of humectant mechanism. Aloe vera gel stimulates fibroblast which produces the collagen and elastin fibers making the skin more elastic and less wrinkled.It inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway and reduces prostaglandin E2. Recently, the novel anti-inflammatory compound called C-glycosyl chromone was isolated from gel extracts.Immunomodulating effects occur via activation of macrophage cells to generate nitric oxide, secrete cytokines and present cell surface markers.Glutathione peroxides activity, superoxide dismutase enzymes and a phenolic antioxidant were found to be present in aloe vera gel, which may be responsible for these antioxidant effects.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Apply on affected area 3 times daily or as directed by the Physician.",
      "Interaction": "In topical administration aloe vera gel is generally considered as safe. Aloe vera gel might enhance the ability of hydrocortisone to reduce swelling if applied topically.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose in patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment is 25 mg once daily or as directed by the physicians.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Alpelisib is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K\u03b1. Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic \u03b1-subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) lead to activation of PI3K\u03b1 and Akt-signaling, cellular transformation and the generation of tumors in in vitro and in vivo models.In breast cancer cell lines, Alpelisib inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K downstream targets, including Akt and showed activity in cell lines harboring a PIK3CA mutation. In vivo, Alpelisib inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and reduced tumor growth in xenograft models, including models of breast cancer.PI3K inhibition by Alpelisib treatment has been shown to induce an increase in estrogen receptor (ER) transcription in breast cancer cells. The combination of Alpelisib and fulvestrant demonstrated increased antitumor activity compared to either treatment alone in xenograft models derived from ER-positive, PIK3CA mutated breast cancer cell lines.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of Alpelisib is 300 mg (two 150 mg film coated tablets) taken orally, once daily, with food. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients should take their dose of Alpelisib at approximately the same time each day. Swallow Alpelisib tablets whole (tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split prior to swallowing). No tablet should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact.If a dose of Alpelisib is missed, it can be taken with food within 9 hours after the time it is usually taken. After more than 9 hours, skip the dose for that day. The next day, take Alpelisib at the usual time.If the patient vomits after taking the dose, advise the patient not to take an additional dose on that day, and to resume the dosing schedule the next day at the usual time. When given with Alpelisib, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered on Days 1, 15, and 29, and once monthly thereafter.",
      "Interaction": "Effect of Other Drugs on Alpelisib-\n\nCYP3A4 Inducer: Coadministration of Alpelisib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease alpelisib concentration, which may decrease Alpelisib activity. Avoid coadministration of Alpelisib with strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBCRP Inhibitors: Coadministration of Alpelisib with a BCRP inhibitor may increase Alpelisib concentration, which may increase the risk of toxicities. Avoid the use of BCRP inhibitors in patients treated with Alpelisib. If unable to use alternative drugs, when Alpelisib is used in combination with BCRP inhibitors, closely monitor for increased adverse reactions.\n\r\nEffect of Alpelisib on Other Drugs-\n\nCYP2C9 Substrates: Coadministration of Alpelisib with CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., Warfarin) may reduce plasma concentration of these drugs. Closely monitor when Alpelisib is used in combination with CYP2C9 substrates where decreases in the plasma concentration of CYP2C9 substrates may reduce activity of these drugs.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Amantadine Hydrochloride has direct and indirect effects on dopamine neurons. It acts on the pre-synaptic membrane, enhancing the release of dopamine and inhibiting its reuptake. Post-synaptically, Amantadine acts directly on the dopamine receptor, and up regulates D2 receptors. This may be due to Amantadine-induced hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors. It has antimuscarinic properties. Amantadine also has antiglutamatergic properties, via non-competitive antagonism of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, potent, competitive, non-subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists reduce the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. NMDA receptor sensitization may be a key event in the genesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. It also has immunomodulatory properties. It restores the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is defective in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients. The mechanism by which Amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. Amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Parkinson's disease-\n\nAdults: The usual dose is 100 mg twice a day when used alone.\nThe initial dose of Amantadine is 100 mg daily for patients with serious associated medical illnesses or who are receiving high doses of other antiparkinson drugs. After one to several weeks at 100 mg once daily, the dose may be increased to 100 mg twice daily, if necessary.\nOccasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with Amantadine at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 400 mg daily in divided doses.\nDosage for Concomitant Therapy: Some patients who do not respond to anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs may respond to Amantadine.\nWhen Amantadine or anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs are each used with marginal benefit, concomitant use may produce additional benefit. When Amantadine and levodopa therapy are initiated concurrently, the patient can exhibit rapid therapeutic benefits. Amantadine dose, should be held constant at 100 mg daily or twice daily while the daily dose of levodopa is gradually increased to optimal benefit.\nWhen Amantadine is added to optimal well-tolerated doses of levodopa, additional benefit may result, including smoothing out the fluctuations in improvement which sometimes occur in patients on levodopa alone. Patients who require a reduction in their usual dose of levodopa because of development of side effects may possibly regain lost benefit with the addition of Amantadine.\n\nDrug-induced extrapyramidal reactions-\n\nAdults: The usual dose is 100 mg twice a day.\nOccasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with Amantadine at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 300 mg daily in divided doses.\n\nProphylaxis and treatment of Influenza A virus illness-\n\nAdults: 200 mg/day as single dose or 100 mg twice daily. If CNS effects develop on a once- daily dosage, split dosage schedule may reduce complaints.\nElderly over 65 years of age: 100 mg every day.\nChildren: 1 to 9 years of age: 4.4 to 8.8 mg/kg/day; not to exceed 150\u2009mg/day. 9 to 12 years of age: 100 mg twice daily\n\nMethod of administration: Each capsule is to be taken orally either with or without food.Patients with renal impairment: The dose should be reduced. This can be achieved by either reducing the total daily dose, or by increasing the dosage interval in accordance with the creatinine clearance.Patients with hepatic impairment: Use with caution.",
      "Interaction": "Concurrent administration of Amantadine and anticholinergic agents or levodopa may increase confusion, hallucinations, nightmares, gastro-intestinal disturbances, or other atropine-like side effects. Psychotic reactions have been observed in patients receiving Amantadine and Levodopa. Concurrent administration of Amantadine and drugs or substances (e.g. alcohol) acting on the CNS may result in additive CNS toxicity. Close observation is recommended.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent autocrine and paracrine peptide. Two receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB, mediate the effects of ET-1 in the vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. The primary actions of ETA are vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, while the predominant actions of ETB are vasodilation, antiproliferation, and ET-1 clearance. Ambrisentan is a high-affinity ETA receptor antagonist with a high selectivity for the ETA versus ETB receptor (>4000-fold). The clinical impact of high selectivity for ETA is not known.The pharmacokinetics of Ambrisentan (S-Ambrisentan) in healthy subjects are dose proportional. The absolute bioavailability of Ambrisentan is not known. Ambrisentan is absorbed with peak concentrations occurring approximately 2 hours after oral administration in healthy subjects and PAH patients. Food does not affect its bioavailability. In vitro studies indicate that Ambrisentan is a substrate of P-gp. Ambrisentan is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%). The elimination of Ambrisentan is predominantly by non-renal pathways, but the relative contributions of metabolism and biliary elimination have not been well characterized. In plasma, the AUC of 4-hydroxymethyl Ambrisentan accounts for approximately 4% relative to parent Ambrisentan AUC. Thein vivo inversion of S-Ambrisentan to R-Ambrisentan is negligible. The mean oral clearance of Ambrisentan is 38 mL/min and 19 mL/min in healthy subjects and in PAH patients, respectively. Although Ambrisentan has a 15-hour terminal half-life, the mean trough concentration of Ambrisentan at steady-state is about 15% of the mean peak concentration and the accumulation factor is about 1.2 after long-term daily dosing, indicating that the effective half-life of Ambrisentan is about 9 hours.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Adult dose: Initial treatment is 5 mg once daily, and can be increased to 10 mg once daily if 5 mg is tolerated. Ambrisentan may be administered with or without food.Pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness of Ambrisentan in pediatric patients have not been established.",
      "Interaction": "Multiple dose co-administration of Ambrisentan and Cyclosporine resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in Ambrisentan exposure in healthy volunteers; therefore, limit the dose of Ambrisentan to 5 mg once daily when co-administered with Cyclosporine.",

      "Pharmacology": "Amiodarone Hydrochloride is used to correct abnormal rhythms of the heart. Amiodarone is considered a \"broad spectrum\" antiarrhythmic medication. The most important electrical effects of the drug includes : a delay in the rate at which the heart\u2019s electrical system \"recharges\" after the heart contracts (repolarisation); a prolongation in the electrical phase during which the heart\u2019s muscle cells are electrically stimulated (action potential); a slowing of the speed of electrical conduction (how fast each individual impulse is conducted through the heart\u2019s electrical system); a reduction in the rapidity of firing of the normal generator of electrical impulses in the heart (the heart\u2019s pacemaker); and a slowing of conduction through various specialised electrical pathways (called accessory pathways). In addition to being an antiarrhythmic medication, Amiodarone also causes blood vessels to dilate. Because of this effect it also may be of benefit in patients with\u00a0 congestive heart failure. This effect can result in drop of blood pressure.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Tablet: 200 mg 3 times daily for 1 week reduced to 200 mg twice daily or the minimum required to control arrhythmia. Amiodarone is usually given in several daily doses to minimize stomach upset which is seen more frequently with higher doses. For this same reason, it is also recommended that Amiodarone should be taken with meals.Injection: The recommended starting dose is about 1000 mg over the first 24 hours of therapy, delivered by the following infusion regimen:\n\nInitial Load: 150 mg per 100 mL (in D5W or Normal Saline) infused over 10 minutes\nFollowed by: 1 mg/min for 6 hours\nFollowed by: 0.5 mg/min thereafter\n\r\nIn the event of breakthrough episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT: Repeat the Initial Load described above as needed (infused over 10 minutes). Increase the rate of maintenance infusion to achieve effective arrhythmia suppression.",
      "Interaction": "Amiodarone may interact with b blockers such as Atenolol, Propranolol, Metoprolol, or certain calcium channel blockers, such as Verapamil or Diltiazem, resulting in an excessively slow heart rate.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Amisulpride belongs to a group of medicines called antipsychotics, which help to control the symptoms of a mental illness called schizophrenia. Amisulpride binds selectively to the human dopaminergic D2 and D3 receptor without any affinity for all, D4 and D5 receptor subtypes. Unlike classical and atypical neuroleptics amisulpride displays low affinity for serotonin, a-adrenergic, histamine receptor subtypes, muscarinic receptors and sigma sites. In addition, it does not induce catalepsy and it does not produce D2 hypersensitivity after repeated treatment. Moreover, it preferentially blocks pre-synaptic D2/D3 dopamine receptors, producing dopamine release responsible for its disinhibitory effects.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Oral dose: For acute psychotic episodes, oral doses between 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day are recommended in individual cases. The daily dose may be increased up to 1200 mg/day. Doses above 800 mg/day have not been shown to be superior to lower doses and may increase the incidence of adverse events. No specific titration is required when initiating the treatment with Amisulpride. Doses should be adjusted according individual response. Dose should preferably be administered before meal. For patients with mixed positive negative symptoms, doses should be adjusted to obtain optimal control of positive symptoms. Maintenance treatment should be established individually with the minimally effective dose. For patients characterized by predominant negative symptoms, oral doses between 50 mg/day and 300 mg/day are recommended. Doses should be adjusted individually.Injectable dose: The recommended injectable adult dosage of Amisulpride and infusion rate by indication is shown in the table below:\n\nPrevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting: 5 mg as a single intravenous injection infused over 1 to 2 minutes at the time of induction of anesthesia.\nTreatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting: 10 mg as a single intravenous injection infused over 1 to 2 minutes in the event of nausea and/or vomiting after a surgical procedure.",
      "Interaction": "With medicine: Consumption of alcohol while taking this medicine can cause CNS depression characterized by confusion, lack of focus, anxiety, drowsiness etc. As the risk of adverse effects are increasingly high uptake of alcohol along with Amisulpride, so uptake of alcohol while taking this medicine should be avoided. Drug Interaction may occur with Diltiazem, Pregabalin, Tramadol, Amiodarone, Quinidine, Bromocriptine, Ropinirole. Concomitant use of amisulpride with other anti-psychotics may increase the risk of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms. Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown.",

      "Pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Hypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg.Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.",

      "Side Effects": "The most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amlodipine may occur.",

      "name": "Amlodipine Besilate + Benazepril Hydrochloride",
      "generic_id": "64",
      "Indications": "This combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. This fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "The combination of Amlodipine and Benazepril is used to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. While the mechanism through which Benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, Benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The rate and extent of absorption of Benazepril and Amlodipine are not significantly different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of Benazepril and Amlodipine from individual tablet formulations. Following oral administration of this capsule, peak plasma concentrations of Benazepril are reached in 0.5-2 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of Amlodipine are reached 6-12 hours after administration of this capsule; the extent of absorption is 64%-90%. Over 700 patients received Benazepril/Amlodipine once daily in five double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Benazepril/Amlodipine lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2-8 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Once-daily doses of Benazepril/Amlodipine using Benazepril doses of 10-20 mg and Amlodipine doses of 2.5-10 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 10-25/6-13 mmHg.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Amlodipine is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5-10 mg while Benazepril is effective in doses of 10-80 mg.It is usually appropriate to begin therapy with this capsule only after a patient has either-\n\nFailed to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect with one or the other monotherapy, or\nDemonstrated inability to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with Amlodipine therapy without developing edema.\n\nDose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine) alone or with Benazepril (or another ACE inhibitor) alone may be switched to combination therapy with this capsule. All patient groups benefit from the reduction in Amlodipine-induced edema. Dosage must be guided by clinical response; steady-state levels of Benazepril an Amlodipine will be reached after approximately 2 and 7 days of dosing respectively.In patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with Amlodipine but who experience unacceptable edema, combination therapy may achieve similar (or better) blood-pressure control without edema. Especially in nonblacks, it may be prudent to minimize the risk of excessive response by reducing the dose of Amlodipine as Benazepril is added to the regimen.Replacement Therapy: For convenience, patients receiving Amlodipine and Benazepril from separate tablets may instead wish to receive this capsule containing the same component doses. In small, elderly, or hepatically impaired patients, the recommended initial dose of Amlodipine, as monotherapy or as a component of combination therapy, is 2.5 mg.",
      "Interaction": "Diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Benazepril/Amlodipine.Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: Benazepril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (Spironolactone, Amiloride, Triamterene and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.Others: Benazepril has been used concomitantly with oral anticoagulants, beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-blocking agents, Cimetidine, diuretics, Digoxin, Hydralazine, and Naproxen without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. In clinical trials, Amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, Digoxin, Warfarin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.",
      "Contraindications": "This capsule is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to Benazepril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or to Amlodipine.",
      "Side Effects": "Benazepril/Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in patients with hypertension for at least 6 months and more than 1 year. The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 4% of patients treated with Benazepril/Amlodipine and in 3% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Benazepril/Amlodipine in U.S. studies were cough and edema. The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with Benazepril/Amlodipine are cough, headache, dizziness and edema.The incidence of edema was statistically greater in patients treated with Amlodipine monotherapy than in patients treated with the combination. Edema and certain other side effects are associated with Amlodipine monotherapy in a dose-dependent manner, and appear to affect women more than men. The addition of Benazepril resulted in lower incidences as shown in study; the protective effect of Benazepril was independent of race and (within the range of doses tested) of dose.Other rare side effects are angioedema, asthenia, fatigue, insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, decreased libido, flushing, hot flashes, rash, skin nodule, dermatitis, dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, esophagitis, hypokalemia, pharyngitis etc.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, this capsule should be discontinued as soon as possible. Minimal amounts of unchanged Benazepril and of benazeprilat are excreted into the breast milk of lactating women treated with Benazepril, so that a newborn child ingesting nothing but breast milk would receive less than 0.1% of the maternal doses of Benazepril and benazeprilat. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while this capsule is administered.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Impaired Renal Function: This capsule should be used with caution in patients with severe renal disease.Hyperkalemia: This may occur in only a few patients but generally are reversible.Patients With Hepatic Failure: Since Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver and the plasma elimination half-life (t \u00bd) is 56 hours in patients with impaired hepatic function, caution should be exercised when administering this capsule to patients with severe hepatic impairment.Cough: ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, Benazepril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No evidence of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or impairment of fertility was found when the Benazepril/Amlodipine combination were given orally.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "This is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Initial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Valsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of Angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of Angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for Angiotensin II synthesis. Amlodipine and Valsartan have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. Both Amlodipine and Valsartan lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance, but calcium influx blockade and reduction of Angiotensin II vasoconstriction are complementary mechanisms.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Treatment of hypertension: Amlodipine is an effective treatment of hypertension in once daily doses of 2.5 mg - 10 mg while Valsartan is effective in doses of 80 mg-320 mg. In clinical trials with Amlodipine and Valsartan, using amlodipine doses of 5 mg-10 mg and Valsartan doses of 160 mg-320 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure. This combination may be administered with or without food. This combination may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Amlodipine alone or with Valsartan alone may be switched to this combination therapy.Elderly patients: Because of decreased clearance of Amlodipine, therapy should usually be initiated at 2.5 mg.Renal Impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

      "Pharmacology": "Pharmacodynamic properties: Co-amoxiclav is an antibacterial combination consisting of the antibiotic Amoxicillin and the (3-lactamase inhibitor Clavulanic Acid. Amoxicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many Gram-positive & Gram-negative microorganisms but it is susceptible to degradation by (3-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not include microorganisms, which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Thus Clavulanic acid in this preparation protects Amoxicillin from degradation by (3-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum to embrace a wide range of microorganisms.Pharmacokinetic properties: The pharmacokinetics of the two components of Co-amoxiclav is closely matched. Peak serum levels of both occur about one hour after oral administration. Absorption of Co-amoxiclav is optimized at the start of a meal. Both clavulanate and Amoxicillin have low levels of serum binding; about 70% remains free in the serum. Doubling the dosage of Co-amoxiclav approximately doubles the serum levels achieved.",

Diarrhoea, pseudomembranous colitis, indigestion, nausea, vomiting and candidiasis have been reported, if gastrointestinal side effects occur with oral therapy, that may be reduced by taking Co-amoxiclav at the start of meals. Hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely but are usually reversible. Urticarial and erythematous rashes sometimes occur. Rarely erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported. In common with other beta-lactam antibiotics, angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Animal studies with orally and parenterally administered Co-amoxiclav have shown no teratogenic effect.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Grafalon is a polyclonal anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin derived from rabbits immunized with Jurkat cells, a lymphoblastoid cell line. The expression of T-cell markers on Jurkat cells is con- sistent with the effects of Grafalon on lymphocytes. Grafalon has been found to contain anti- bodies against further surface antigens of Jurkat cells. Analysis of lymphocyte subsets in patients who received Grafalon, showed a decrease in lymphocyte subsets carrying surface proteins, which are expressed by the Jurkat cell line. Grafalon is cytotoxic against human lymphocytes. Data show that activated lymphocytes are more susceptible. Grafalon did not activate T-cells (via CD3) or lymphocytes but inhibited activation of T-cells by an anti-CD3 antibody. Grafalon reduced migration of human melanoma cells by binding to adhesion molecules. Anti-adhesive properties (anti-LFA-1 and anti-ICAM-1 activity) might explain why addition of Grafalon diminished the vascular resistance of kidney vessels and reduced lymphocyte retention in the kidney when porcine kidneys were perfused with human lymphocytes incubated with or without Grafalon. Grafalon prolonged skin graft survival in rhesus monkeys. Immunosuppression was evident in this model and leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed. In cynomolgus monkeys, Grafalon had a beneficial effect on ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibition of adhesion of lymphocytes and neutrophils.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The dose of Grafalon is dependent on the indication. Dose recommendations are based on body weight.Prevention of acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic solid organ transplants: The recommended dose range is 2 to 5 mg/kg/d of Grafalon. The most common doses are in the range of 3 to 4 mg/kg/d. Therapy should commence on the day of transplantation pre-, intra-, or immediately post-operatively. Depending on the patient's condition, selected daily dose and the concomitant immunosuppressive regimen, the recommended duration of therapy is in the range of 5 to 14 days.Therapy of acute corticosteroid-resistant rejection after allogeneic solid organ transplantation: The recommended dose range is 3 to 5 mg/kg/d of Grafalon. The most common dosages are in the range of 3 to 4 mg/kg/d. Duration of therapy will vary according to the condition of the grafted organ and clinical response, usually between 5 to 14 days. Prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adults after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT): As part of myeloablative conditioning regimens for stem cell transplantation, the recommended dose is 20 mg/kg/d of Grafalon, usually starting from day -3 to day -1 prior to SCT.",
      "Interaction": "Immunosuppressive medicinal products: In addition to Grafalon, other concomitant immunosuppressive medicinal products are routinely administered. No direct interaction between Grafalon and corticosteroids, purin antagonists, calcineurin inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors has been observed. However, the co-administration of these medicinal products may increase the risk of infection, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Thus, patients receiving combined immunosuppressive therapies are to be monitored carefully and an adequate adaptation of the regimen is recommended.Vaccination: For immunosuppressed patients live-attenuated virus vaccination is contraindicated. The anti-body response to other vaccines may be diminished",

      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The potential risk for the fetus is unknown. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. At least human immunoglobulin can potentially penetrate the placental barrier or be excreted into human breast milk. Therefore, the decision to treat pregnant or lactating women should be made by the treating physician and based on a risk/benefit evaluation.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Patients receiving Grafalon must be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources to provide emergency treatment if necessary. Grafalon must be administered and monitored under qualified medical supervision.Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the administration of Grafalon. Before the first administration of Grafalon, it is recommended to determine whether the patient has an anamnestical allergic predisposition, in particular to rabbit proteins. In case of re-exposition in form of re-therapy with Grafalon or treatment with rabbit-immuno-globulin preparations of other manufacturers, the risk of developing an anaphylactic reaction is increased due to a possible sensitisation during the former therapy.Severe thrombocytopenia: Treatment with Grafalon should be interrupted or stopped in solid organ transplant patients in whom severe thrombocytopenia develops (i.e. less than 50,000 platelets/\u03bcl) as Grafalon may enhance thrombocytopenia and thus increase the risk of hemorrhage. Clinical personnel should be prepared for appropriate emergency measures.Hepatic disorders: Grafalon has to be administered with special caution in patients with hepatic diseases. Pre-existing clotting disorders may aggravate. Careful monitoring of thrombocytes and coagulation parameters is recommended.Cardiovascular disorders: Grafalon has to be administered with special caution in patients with known or suspected cardio-vascular disorders.

For the active moieties (sum of apalutamide plus the potency adjusted active metabolite), Cmax decreased by 21% while AUC increased by 45%. No initial dose adjustment is necessary when Apalutamide is co-administered with a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil, clopidogrel) however, a reduction of the Apalutamide dose based on tolerability should be considered.Mild or moderate inhibitors of CYP2C8 are not expected to affect the exposure of Apalutamide.Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4: CYP3A4 plays a role in the elimination of Apalutamide and in the formation of its active metabolite. In a drug-drug interaction study, the Cmax of apalutamide decreased by 22% while AUC was similar following co-administration of Apalutamide as a 240 mg single dose with itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). For the active moieties (sum of apalutamide plus the potency adjusted active metabolite), Cmax decreased by 22% while AUC was again similar. No initial dose adjustment is necessary when Apalutamide is co-administered with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) however, a reduction of the Apalutamide dose based on tolerability should be considered .Mild or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 are not expected to affect the exposure of Apalutamide.Medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 or CYP2C8: The effects of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducers on the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide have not been evaluated in vivo. Based on the drug-drug interaction study results with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducers are not expected to have clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide and the active moieties therefore no dose adjustment is necessary when Apalutamide is co-administered with inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8.Effect of Apalutamide on Other Drugs: CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and UGT Substrates: Apalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and a weak inducer of CYP2C9 in humans. Concomitant use of Apalutamide with medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 can result in lower exposure to these medications. Substitution for these medications is recommended when possible or evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued. Concomitant administration of Apalutamide with medications that are substrates of UDP-giucuronosyl transferase (UGT) can result in decreased exposure. Use caution if substrates of UGT must be co-administered with Apalutamide and evaluate for loss of activity. P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 Substrates: Apalutamide was shown to be a weak inducer of P-glycoprotein(P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) clinically. At steady-state, Apalutamide reduced the plasma exposure to fexofenadine (a P-gp substrate) and rosuvastatin (a BCRP/OATP1B1 substrate). Concomitant use of Apalutamide with medications that are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1 can result in lower exposure of these medications. Use caution if substrates of P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B must be co-administered with Apalutamide and evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued.",

      "Side Effects": "The following clinically significant adverse reactions are observed in clinical trial:\n\nEndocrine disorders: Hypothyroidism\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia\nNervous system disorders: Dysgeusia, seizure\nCardiac disorders: ischaemic heart disease\nVascular disorders: hot flush, hypertension\nGastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: skin rash, pruritus\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: fracture, arthralgia, muscle spasm\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue\nInvestigations: weight decreased\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall, fracture",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Apalutamide is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Based on its mechanism of action, Apalutamide may cause foetal harm when administered during pregnancy. There are no data available from the use of Apalutamide in pregnant women. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with Apalutamide.Breast-feeding: It is unknown whether apalutamide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Apalutamide should not be used during breast-feeding.Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Contraception in males and females: It is not known whether apalutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. Apalutamide may be harmful to a developing foetus. For patients having sex with female partners of reproductive potential, a condom should be used along with another highly effective contraceptive method during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of Apalutamide. Fertility: Based on animal studies, Apalutamide may decrease fertility in males of reproductive potential.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Seizure: Apalutamide is not recommended in patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing factors including, but not limited to, underlying brain injury, recent stroke (within one year), primary brain tumours or brain metastases. If a seizure develops during treatment with Apalutamide, treatment should be discontinued permanently. In two randomised studies (SPARTAN and TITAN), seizure occurred in 0.4% of patients receiving apalutamide and in 0.2% of patients treated with placebo. These studies excluded patients with a history of seizure or predisposing factors for seizure.Falls and fractures: Falls and fractures occurred in patients receiving apalutamide. Patients should be evaluated for fracture and fall risk before starting Apalutamide and should continue to be monitored and managed according to established treatment guidelines and use of bone-targeted agents should be considered.Ischaemic heart disease: Ischaemic heart disease, including events leading to death, occurred in patients treated with Apalutamide. The majority of patients had cardiac risk factors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ischaemic heart disease and management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidaemia should be optimised as per standard of care.Concomitant use with other medicinal products: Apalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used medicinal products. Concomitant use of apalutamide with medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters should generally be avoided if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and if dose adjustments cannot easily be performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations. Co administration of apalutamide with warfarin and coumarin-Iike anticoagulants should be avoided. If Apalutamide is co-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin or acenocoumarol), additional International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring should be conducted.Recent cardiovascular disease: Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease in the past 6 months including severe/unstabie angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, arterial or venous thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischaemic attacks), or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias were excluded from the clinical studies. Therefore, the safety of apalutamide in these patients has not been established. If Apalutamide is prescribed, patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease should be monitored for risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, or other cardio-metabolic disorders. Patients should be treated after initiating Apalutamide for these conditions according to established treatment guidelines.Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval: In patients with a history of or risk factors for QT prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products that might prolong the QT interval, physicians should assess the benefit-risk ratio including the potential for Torsade de pointes prior to initiating Apalutamide.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Apixaban acts by inhibiting coagulation, and thus prevents development of blood clots. As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended Dose: The recommended dose of Apixaban for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.Dosage Adjustments: The recommended dose of Apixaban is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with any 2 of the following characteristics: age \u226580 years, body weight \u226460 kg, serum creatinine \u22651.5mg/dl.CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors: When Apixaban is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily.Missed Dose: If a dose of Apixaban is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions: Apixaban should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. Apixaban should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled.Switching from or to Apixaban: Switching from warfarin to Apixaban: Warfarin should be discontinued and Apixaban started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.Switching from Apixaban to warfarin: Apixaban affects INR, so that INR measurements during co-administration with warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. If continuous anticoagulation is necessary, discontinue Apixaban and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of Apixaban would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.Switching between Apixaban and anticoagulants other than warfarin: Discontinue one being taken and begin the other at the next scheduled dose.",
      "Interaction": "Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp increase exposure to Apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp decrease exposure to Apixaban and increase the risk of stroke.",
      "Contraindications": "Apixaban is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: Active pathological bleeding. Severe hypersensitivity reaction to Apixaban (i.e. anaphylactic reactions).",

Read moreOne of many side effects of radiotherapy are skin changes. They are caused by distortion of skin barrier function. These changes include: rash, skin dryness, hyperpigmentation, inflammations, desquamation of the skin etc. Moreover skin is more prone to infections and allergy and more sensitive to UV radiation. Skin problems can cause: pain, strong discomfort, diminish quality of life and can be reason of therapy termination or its delay. Therefore very important is proper skin care, primarily its moisturizing and lubricating. Proper skin hydration reduces dryness, tension and itching, thereby protects from infection caused by skin scratching.OncoMed gel on skin after radiotherapy contains numerous moisturizing substances like glycerin, arginine and sodium hyaluronate and strongly lubricating oil Omega Plus complex. Additionally contained in the device Syricalm protects from excessive water loss and strengthens skin protective barrier. Thanks to this the skin is more elastic, moistened and less prone to action of external factors, what helps to reduce feeling of tension and itching. Due to proper skin hydration, the appropriate environment is maintained, which favors natural regenerating processes.Moreover contained in the device-prebiotic Biolin-ensures adequate environment for physiological bacterial flora development, what protects from development of pathogenic microorganisms.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "This preparation contains a fixed ratio of 1:6 parts of Artemether and Lumefantrine respectively. Artemether is a derivative of naturally occurring substance Artemisinin. Lumefantrine is a synthetic racemic fluorine mixture belonging to the aryl amino alcohol family like other anti-malarials (e.g. Quinine, mafloquine, halofantrine). Both components act in the food vacuoles of malarial parasites, where they are thought to interfere with the conversion of haem, a toxic intermediate formed during haemoglobin breakdown, to the non-toxic haemozin (a malaria pigment). Lumefantrine is thought to interfere with the polymerization process, while Artemether generates reactive metabolites as a result of interaction between the peroxide bridge and haem iron. Both Artemether and Lumefantrine have a secondary action involving inhibition of nucleic acid - protein synthesis within the malarial parasites. This tablet did not induce resistance. This tablet is active against blood stages of Plasmodium vivax, but it is not active against hypnozoites. Therefore, sequential treatment with premaquine should be used to achieve hypnozoite eradication.",

It may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, particularly with a thiazide-type diuretic.\nFor the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris.\nIn the management of hemodynamically stable patients with defnite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "The synthesis of atenolol resulted from attempts to produce a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist that would competitively block \u03b21 (cardiac) receptors but have no effect on \u03b22-receptors. It is classified as a \u03b21 selective (cardioselective) \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with no membranestability activity and no partial agonist activity. It is markedly the most hydrophilic of the currently available \u03b2- blockers and thus penetrates the lipid of cell membranes poorly",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Hypertension: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.Angina Pectoris: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg.Acute Myocardial Infarction: In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with Atenolol I.V. Injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg Atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), Atenolol Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, Atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6-9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, Atenolol should be discontinued.",
      "Interaction": "Catecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Atenolol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.\nCalcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with Atenolol.\nDisopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers.\nAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers.\nBeta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.\nConcomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers.\nWhile taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.\nBoth digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.",
      "Contraindications": "Atenolol is contraindicated in-\n\nSinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure.\nThose patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the atenolol or any of the drug product\u2019s components.",
      "Side Effects": "In a series of investigations in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly, as expected for any beta blocker. In addition, a variety of adverse efects has been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered potential adverse efects of Atenolol.\n\nHematologic: Agranulocytosis.\nAllergic: Fever, combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.\nCentral Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place; short term memory loss; emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium; and, decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.\nGastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis.\nMiscellaneous: There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy.\nOther: Erythematous rash",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. Caution should be exercised when Atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breast-fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "General: Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before Atenolol is administered. Initial and subsequent Atenolol dosages can be adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Atenolol may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.Impaired Renal Function: The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.Geriatric Use: \n\nHypertension and Angina Pectoris: Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\nAcute Myocardial Infarction: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity through the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and can contribute to the inhibition of the antitumor immune response in the microenvironment. Atezolizumab is an Fc-engineered humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that directly binds to PD-L1 and blocks interactions with the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors, releasing PD-L1 / PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including reactivating the antitumor immune response. Atezolizumab leaves the PD-L2/PD-1 interaction intact. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-L1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth",
      "Dosage & Administration": "General: Atezolizumab must be administered as an intravenousinfusion under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. Substitution by any other biological medicinal product requires the consent of the prescribing physician.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "The precise mechanism by which Atomoxetine produces its therapeutic effects in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is unknown. But, it is thought to be related to selective inhibition of the pre-synaptic nor-epinephrine transporter. Atomoxetine is well-absorbed after oral administration and is minimally affected by food. It is eliminated primarily by oxidative metabolism through the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymatic pathway.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Children and Adolescents up to 70 kg Body Weight:\u00a0Atomoxetine should be initiated at a total\u00a0daily dose of approximately 0.5 mg/kg and increased after a minimum of three days to a\u00a0target total daily dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg administered either as a single daily\u00a0dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon/early\u00a0evening. After an additional two to four weeks, the total daily dose may be increased to a\u00a0maximum of 1.4 mg/kg in patients who have not achieved an optimal response. The\u00a0maximum recommended total daily dose in children and adolescents is 1.4 mg/kg or\u00a0100mg, whichever is less.Children and Adolescents over 70 kg Body Weight and Adults:\u00a0Atomoxetine should be initiated\u00a0at a total daily dose of 40mg and increased after a minimum of three days to a target total\u00a0daily dose of approximately 80mg administered either as a single daily dose in the\u00a0morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon/early evening. After\u00a0an additional two to four weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 100mg in\u00a0patients who have not achieved an optimal response. The maximum recommended total\u00a0daily dose in children and adolescents over 70 kg is 100mg.Maintenance/Extended Treatment:\u00a0There is no evidence available from controlled trials to\u00a0indicate how long the patient with ADHD should be treated with Atomoxetine. It is\u00a0generally agreed, however, that pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for\u00a0extended periods. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Atomoxetine for\u00a0extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the\u00a0medicine for the individual patient.Pediatric use:\u00a0The pharmacokinetics of Atomoxetine have not been evaluated in children\u00a0under 6 years of age.",
      "Interaction": "Slower titration of Atomoxetine may be necessary in those patients who are also taking CYP2D6 inhibitor medicines. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors- Atomoxetine should not be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within two weeks after discontinuing MAOIs. Treatment with MAOIs should not be initiated within two weeks after discontinuing Atomoxetine. Anti-hypertensive drugs and Vasopressor Agents- Because of possible effects on blood pressure, Atomoxetine should be used cautiously with Anti-hypertensive drugs and vasopressor agents or other drugs that increase blood pressure. Tricyclic Antidepressants- Atomoxetine can increase the adverse cardiovascular effects of tricyclic antidepressants if co-administered.",
      "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity:\u00a0Atomoxetine is contra-indicated in patients with\u00a0known hypersensitivity to it. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Atomoxetine should not be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within two weeks after discontinuing MAOIs. Treatment with MAOIs should not be initiated within two weeks after discontinuing Atomoxetine. With other medicines that affect brain monoamine concentrations, there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions when taken in combination with MAOIs. These reactions include hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Such reactions may occur when these medicines are given concurrently or in close proximity.Narrow Angle Glaucoma: In clinical studies, the\u00a0use of Atomoxetine was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis and therefore not\u00a0recommended in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Atomoxetine is contra-indicated in\u00a0patients with: Severe Cardiovascular Disorders, symptomatic cardiovascular diseases,\u00a0uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, phaeochromocytoma.",
      "Side Effects": "Very common: blood pressure increased, heart rate increased. Common: abdominal pain, rash, dyspepsia, early morning awakening, ejaculation disorder, ejaculation failure, fatigue, lethargy, tachycardia, paraesthesia, chills.Uncommon: peripheral coldness.",

      "Precautions & Warnings": "Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour: Suicidal ideation (suicidal thoughts) was statistically more frequently observed in clinical trials among children and adolescents treated with Atomoxetine (5/1357; [0.37%]) compared to those treated with placebo (0/851; [0%]). There was one report of suicidal behaviour in a patient in this age group treated with Atomoxetine compared with no reports in patients treated with placebo. Aggressive Behaviour or Hostility: Although there is no conclusive evidence that Atomoxetine causes aggressive behaviour or hostility, during clinical trials these events were more frequently observed in children and adolescents treated with Atomoxetine compared to those receiving placebo (overall risk ratio of 1.33- not statistically significant). Seizures: The pre-clinical and clinical trial data for Atomoxetine do not suggest that Atomoxetine is proconvulsive. However, seizures have been very rarely reported in post-marketing spontaneous reports. Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures. Cardiovascular Effects: Atomoxetine can affect heart rate and blood pressure. It is recommended that the heart rate and blood pressure be measured before treatment is started and periodically during treatment to detect possible clinically important increases.",

Read moreTherapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.Primary Hyperlipidemia: This combination tablet is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): This combination tablet is indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Atorvastatin: In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.Ezetimibe: Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The dosage range is 10/10 mg to 80/20 mg daily. The recommended starting dose is 10/10 mg or 20/10 mg daily. This can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The recommended starting dose for patients who require a larger reduction in LDL-C (greater than 55%) is 40/10 mg daily. After initiation and/or upon titration of this medicine, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 or more weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is 40/10 mg or 80/10 mg daily. This should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: This is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels. Patients with Renal Impairment: A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for statin-associated myopathy. These patients need closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. In patients with renal impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary.",
      "Interaction": "The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole). The coadministration of this combination with cyclosporine should be avoided. Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of this combination with gemfibrozil should be avoided. The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when this combination is used in combination with niacin. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. The increase in AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking this combination. Caution should be exercised when prescribing this combination with colchicine. If this combination is added to warfarin, a coumarin anticoagulant, the International Normalized Ratio (INR) should be appropriately monitored.",
      "Contraindications": "Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels. Hypersensitivity to any component of this preparation.",
      "Side Effects": "Common side effects are rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, liver enzyme abnormalities, myalgia, abdominal pain, increased hepatic enzymes.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category X. This tablet is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid-lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy, because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long-term outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing this combination with colchicine. This combination therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis.Liver Enzymes: It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with this combination and repeated as clinically indicated. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with this combination, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart this combination. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of this combination.Endocrine Function: Caution should be exercised if this combination is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Atorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.Absorption: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Primary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia-\n\nAdults: Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily.\nChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily.\n\r\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia-\n\nAdults: Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia).\nChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily.\n\r\nPrevention of cardiovascular events-\n\nAdults: Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response.\n\nAnother guideline:\u00a0The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.",
      "Interaction": "The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals.Antacid: When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.Digoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.Warfarin: Atorvastatin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.",

      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Atorvastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant women has not been established. No controlled clinical trials with atorvastatin have been conducted in pregnant women. Rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. Animal studies have shown toxicity to reproduction. Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnantLactation: It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "It binds to membrane bound oxytocin receptors on the myometrium and prevents oxytocin-stimulated increases in inositol triphosphate production. This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence.Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling. This agonism produces a pro-inflammatory effect in the human amnion, activating pro-inflammatory signal tranducer NF-\u03baB. It is thought that this reduces atosiban's effectiveness compared to agents which do not produce inflammation as inflammatory mediators are known to play a role in the induction of labour.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Atosiban is administered intravenously in three successive stages: an initial bolus dose (6.75 mg), performed with Atosiban 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection, immediately followed by a continuous high dose infusion (loading infusion 300 micrograms/min) of Atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion during three hours, followed by a lower dose of Atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion (subsequent infusion 100 micrograms/min) up to 45 hours. The duration of the treatment should not exceed 48 hours. The total dose given during a full course of Atosiban therapy should preferably not exceed 330.75 mg of atosiban.",
      "Interaction": "It is unlikely that atosiban is involved in cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions as in vitro investigations have shown that atosiban is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system, and does not inhibit the drug metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. Interaction studies have been performed with labetalol and betamethasone in healthy, female volunteers.

      "Precautions & Warnings": "When Atosiban is used in patients in whom premature rupture of membranes cannot be excluded, the benefits of delaying delivery should be balanced against the potential risk of chorioamnionitis.\nThere is no experience with Atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of Atosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, Atosiban should be used with caution\nThere is only limited clinical experience in the use of Atosiban in multiple pregnancies or the gestational age group between 24 and 27 weeks, because of the small number of patients treated. The benefit of Atosiban in these subgroups is therefore uncertain.\nRe-treatment with Atosiban is possible, but there is only limited clinical experience available with multiple re-treatments, up to 3 re-treatments.\nIn case of intrauterine growth retardation, the decision to continue or reinitiate the administration of Atosiban\u00a0depends on the assessment of fetal maturity.\nMonitoring of uterine contractions and fetal heart rate during administration of Atosiban and in case of persistent uterine contractions should be considered.\nAs an antagonist of oxytocin, Atosiban may theoretically facilitate uterine relaxation and postpartum bleeding therefore blood loss after delivery should be monitored. However, inadequate uterus contraction postpartum was not observed during the clinical trials.\nMultiple pregnancy and medicinal products with tocolytic activity like calcium channel blockers and beta- mimetics are known to be associated with increased risk of pulmonary oedema. Therefore, Atosiban should be used with caution in case of multiple pregnancy and/or concomitant administration of other medicinal products with tocolytic activity",

Read moreAtropine Sulfate Injection is indicated in-Cardiovascular disorders: It is used in a variety of disorders or circumstances in which bradyarrhythmias occur. It is frequently used in sudden onset bradyarrhythmias and although it may also be employed for the initial treatment of chronic arrhythmias, cardiac pacing is generally preferred for long-term control. Examples of acute use include the prevention and treatment of arrhythmias associated with anaesthesia, the treatment of other drug-induced arrhythmias, and in cardiac arrest due to asystole. It has been used in the management of bradycardia of acute myocardial infarction; however, caution is required, as it may exacerbate ischaemia or infarction in these patients.Anaesthetic premedication: It is given before the induction of general anaesthesia to diminish the risk of vagal inhibition of the heart and to reduce the salivary and bronchial secretions.Anticholinesterase and mushroom poisoning.For control of muscarinic side-effects of neostigmine in reversal of competitive neuromuscular block.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Atropine binds to and inhibit muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, producing a wide range of anticholinergic effects. Atropine is an anticholinergic agent which competitively blocks the muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues such as the heart, intestines, bronchial muscles, iris and secretory glands. Some central stimulation may occur. Atropine abolishes bradycardia and reduces heart block due to vagal activity. Smooth muscles in the bronchi and gut are relaxed while glandular secretions are reduced. It also has mydriatic and cycloplegic effect.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "In cardiovascular disorders: Typical initial doses are in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg intravenously. In less severe cases doses may be repeated, as necessary, upto a total dose of 0.03 mg per kg body-weight (about 2 mg); suggested dosage intervals have ranged from 3 to 5 minutes to 1 to 2 hours. In severe instances, as in asystole, a total dose of 0.04 mg per kg (about 3 mg) may be given; some authorities have recommended that the total amount should be given in three divided doses of 1 mg at 3 to 5 minute intervals whereas others consider that 3 mg should be given as a single dose.As anaesthetic premedication: 300 to 600 mcg may be given by subcutaneous (S.C.) or intramuscular (I.M.) injection, usually 30 to 60 minutes before anaesthesia. Alternatively 300 to 600 mcg may be given intravenously immediately before induction of anaesthesia. It may also be given in combination with upto 10 mg morphine sulphate by S.C. or I.M. injection about an hour before anaesthesia.Suitable paediatric premedication doses are:\n\nChildren weighing upto 3 kg: 100 mcg subcutaneously.\nChildren weighing 7-9 kg: 200 mcg subcutaneously.\nChildren weighing 12-16 kg: 300 mcg subcutaneously.\nChildren weighing 20-27 kg: 400 mcg subcutaneously.\nChildren weighing 32 kg: 500 mcg subcutaneously.\nChildren weighing 41 kg: 600 mcg subcutaneously.\n\nIn anticholinesterase and mushroom poisoning: It is used in very large doses, e.g. beginning with a dose of 2 mg intravenously or intramuscularly and repeating every 5 to 15 minutes as necessary until signs and symptoms disappear. Doses of up to 100 mg may be needed in the first 24 hours, and lower oral doses should be continued to prevent reappearance of symptoms.For control of muscarinic side-effects of neostigmine: 0.6 to 1.2 mg by intravenous injection in conjunction with neostigmine methylsulphate.Infants and children are particularly susceptible to toxic effects of atropine.",
      "Interaction": "Peripheral and central nervous system anticholinergic action is additive with other drugs which have anticholinergic activity for example, tricyclic antidepressants, other antispasmodics and antiparkinsonian drugs, some antihistamines, phenothiazines, disopyramide and quinidine. By delaying gastric emptying, atropine may delay the onset of action of other drugs and in some cases increase absorption. Addition of metoclopramide accentuates the reduction of lower oesophageal pressure produced by atropine premedication, and may thus protect against aspiration of gastric contents.",
      "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, chronic lung disease, unstable cardiac rhythm, prostatic hypertrophy, reflux oesophagitis, paralytic ileus or pyloric stenosis, and generally, in the elderly.",
      "Side Effects": "Dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accomodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing, dryness of skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia with palpitations and arrhythmias, difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of GIT leading to constipation. Occasionally vomiting may also occur.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "It has negligible effects on the human uterus and is not teratogenic. Small quantities of atropine appears in breast milk when the drug is given to lactating mothers. It has also been reported to impair milk production, although this is not conclusively documented.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "It should be used with caution in children, and in geriatric patients, who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects. It is generally advisable to be cautious in giving atropine to any patient with diarrhoea. Due to the risk of provoking hyperpyrexia atropine should not be given to patients, especially children when the ambient temperature is high. It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. Persons with Down's syndrome appear to have an increased susceptibility to the actions of atropine. It should be used with caution in conditions characterised by tachycardia such as thyrotoxicosis, heart failure, and in cardiac surgery, where it may further accelerate the heart rate. Care is required in patients with acute myocardial infarction as ischaemia and infarction may be made worse. It should be given with care to patients with hypertension.Atropine may cause mental confusion, especially in the elderly. Reduced bronchial secretion caused by systemic administration of atropine may be associated with the formation of mucous plugs.In the treatment of parkinsonism, increases in dosage and transfer to other forms of treatment should be gradual and antimuscarinic agents should not be withdrawn abruptly. Minor reactions may be controlled by reducing the dose until tolerance has developed.",

      "Pharmacology": "The exact mode of action of Atropine Sulfate is attributed to the suppression of the progression of myopia. Muscarinic receptors are widely distributed in ocular tissues, with roles in ocular growth and development, as well as accommodation, recognized. Preclinical studies suggest that Atropine Sulfate acts via binding to the muscarinic receptors located on scleral fibroblasts and possibly in the retina, primarily the M1, M3 and M4 subtypes. This results in changes in the activity of cell signaling proteins and enzymes such as MEK-ERK-MAPK and transglutaminases, and possibly dopamine release, causing scleral remodeling or strengthening, leading to a reduction in axial length and vitreous chamber depth and consequently a suppression of myopia progression.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "1% ophthalmic preparation-\n\nFor uveitis: One drop three times daily\nFor refraction: One drop in the eyes twice daily for one or two days before examination, and one hour before examination. Pressure should be maintained over lacrimal sac, occluding lacrimal duct for one minute after instillation.\n\n0.01% ophthalmic preparation- This paediatric eye drops should be administered as one drop to each eye at night. The maximum benefit of treatment may not be achieved with less than a 2-year continued administration period. To minimize the risk of systemic absorption, gentle pressure should be applied to the tear duct for one minute after application.",

      "Pharmacology": "Avanafil is a selective phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) enzyme inhibitor used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction caused by diabetes, age induced oxidative stress or other complications. Avanafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penis erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penis blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penis arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) by avanafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dose is 100 mg taken approximately 15 minutes before sexual activity, on an as needed basis. Avanafil may be taken with or without food. Avanafil must not be taken more than once a day. The dose may be increased to 200 mg or decreased to 50 mg based on efficacy and/or tolerability. Use the lowest dose that provides benefit. Concomitant use of nitrates in any form is contraindicated. Do not use Avanafil with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If taking a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose should be no more than 50 mg in a 24-hour period. In patients on stable alpha-blocker therapy, the recommended starting dose of Avanafil is 50 mg.",

      "Indications": "Azacitidine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with the following FAB myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes: Refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL).",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine that inhibits DNA/RNA methyltransferases. Azacitidine is incorporated into DNA and RNA following cellular uptake and enzymatic biotransformation to nucleotide triphosphates. Incorporation of Azacitidine into the DNA of cancer cells in vitro, including acute myeloid leukemia cells, inhibited DNA methyltransferases, reduced DNA methylation and altered gene expression, including re-expression of genes regulating tumor suppression and cell differentiation. Incorporation of Azacitidine into the RNA of cancer cells, including leukemic cells, inhibited RNA methyltransferases, reduced RNA methylation, decreased RNA stability and decreased protein synthesis. Antileukemic activity of Azacitidine was demonstrated by reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in AML cell lines in vitro. Azacitidine decreased tumor burden and increased survival in leukemic tumor models in vivo.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Do not substitute Azacitidine for intravenous or subcutaneous Azacitidine. The indications and dosing regimen for Azacitidine differ from that of intravenous or subcutaneous Azacitidine.Recommended Dosage: The recommended dosage of Azacitidine is 300 mg orally once daily with or without food on Days 1 through 14 of each 28-day cycle. Continue Azacitidine until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Administer an antiemetic 30 minutes prior to each dose of Azacitidine for the first 2 cycles. Antiemetic prophylaxis may be omitted after 2 cycles if there has been no nausea and vomiting. If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 0.5 Gi/L on Day 1 of a cycle, do not administer Azacitidine (Azacitidine). Delay the start of the cycle until the ANC is 0.5 Gi/L or more.Instruct patients on the following:\n\nDo not split, crush, or chew Azacitidine tablets.\nTake a dose about the same time each day.\nIf a dose of Azacitidine is missed, or not taken at the usual time, take the dose as soon as possible on the same day, and resume the normal schedule the following day. Do not take 2 doses on the same day.\nIf a dose is vomited, do not take another dose on the same day. Resume the normal schedule the following day. Azacitidine is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.\n\nMonitoring and Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions: Monitor complete blood count every other week for the first 2 cycles and prior to the start of each cycle thereafter. Increase monitoring to every other week for the 2 cycles after any dose reduction for myelosuppression.",

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of intravenous or subcutaneousAzacitidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is notalways possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n\nHypersensitivity reaction\nInterstitial lung disease\nTumor lysis syndrome\nSweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis)\nNecrotizing fasciitis (including fatal cases)\nDifferentiation syndrome",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on Azacitidine use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug associated risk. Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal lethality in animals at doses less than the recommended human daily dose of oral Azacitidine on a mg/m2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of Azacitidine in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Azacitidine and for 1 week after the last dose.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, the recommended dose and schedule for Azacitidine are different from those for the intravenous or subcutaneous Azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using intravenous or subcutaneous Azacitidine at the recommended dosage of Azacitidinemay result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment of patients using Azacitidine at the doses recommended for intravenous or subcutaneous Azacitidine may not be effective. Do not substitute Azacitidine for intravenous or subcutaneous Azacitidine.Myelosuppression: New or worsening Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 49% and 22% of patients who received Azacitidine, respectively. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 12%. A dose reduction was required for 7% and 2% of patients due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Less than 1% of patients discontinued Azacitidine due to either neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Monitor complete blood counts and modify the dosage as recommended. Provide standard supportive care, including hematopoietic growth factors, if myelosuppression occurs.Increased Early Mortality in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes: In AZA-MDS-003 (NCT01566695), 216 patients with red blood cell transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia due to myelodysplastic syndromes were randomized to Azacitidine or placebo. One hundred and seven patients received a median of 5 cycles of Azacitidine 300 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Enrollment was discontinued early due to a higher incidence of early fatal and/or serious adverse reactions in patients who received Azacitidine compared with placebo. The most frequent fatal adverse reaction was sepsis. The safety and effectiveness of Azacitidine for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes have not been established. Treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with Azacitidine is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, Azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal dose less than the recommended human daily dose of oral Azacitidine on a mg/m2 basis caused fetal death and anomalies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Azacitidine and for atleast 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effectivecontraception during treatment with Azacitidine and for at least 3 months after the last dose.",

Read moreAzathioprine is used as an immunosuppressant antimetabolite either alone or, more commonly, in combination with other agents (usually corticosteroids) and procedures which influence the immune response. Therapeutic effect may be evident only after weeks or months and can include a steroid-sparing effect, thereby reducing the toxicity associated with high dosage and prolonged usage of corticosteroids.Azathioprine, combination with corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents and procedures, is indicated to enhance the survival of organ transplants, such as renal transplants, cardiac transplants, and hepatic transplants. It also reduces the corticosteroid requirements of renal transplant recipients.Azathioprine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) in patients in whom corticosteroid therapy is required, in patients who cannot tolerate corticosteroid therapy, or in patients whose disease is refractory to other standard first line therapy.Azathioprine either alone or more usually in combination with corticosteroids and/or other medicinal products and procedures, has been used with clinical benefit (which may include reduction of dosage or discontinuation of corticosteroids) in a proportion of patients suffering from the following:\n\nSevere active rheumatoid arthritis;\nSystemic lupus erythematosus;\nDermatomyositis and polymyositis;\nAuto-immune chronic active hepatitis;\nPemphigus vulgaris\nPolyarteritis nodosa;\nAuto-immune haemolytic anaemia;\nChronic refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive antimetabolite, chemically 6-[(1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazol-5-yl)thio]-1H-purine. It is an imidazolyl derivative of 6-mercaptopurine and many of its biological effects are similar to those of the parent compound.Azathioprine is an imidazole derivative of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). It is rapidly broken down in vivo into 6-MP and amethylnitroimidazole moiety. The 6-MP readily crosses cell membranes and is converted intracellularly into a number of purine thioanalogues, which include the main active nucleotide, thioinosinic acid. The rate of conversion varies from one person to another. Nucleotides do not traverse cell membranes and therefore do not circulate in body fluids. Irrespective of whether it is given directly or is derived in vivo from azathioprine, 6-MP is eliminated mainly as the inactive oxidised metabolite thiouric acid. This oxidation is brought about by xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that is inhibited by allopurinol. The activity of the methylnitroimidazole moiety has not been defined clearly. However, in several systems it appears to modify the activity of azathioprine as compared with that of 6-MP. Determination of plasma concentrations of azathioprine or 6-MP have no prognostic value as regards effectiveness or toxicity of these compounds.Because of these mechanisms, the therapeutic effect of azathioprine may be evident only after several weeks or months of treatment. Azathioprine appears to be well absorbed from the upper gastro-intestinal tract. Plasma levels of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine do not correlate well with the therapeutic efficacy or toxicity of azathioprine.Absorption: Azathioprine is well absorbed following oral administration. Although there are no food effect studies with azathioprine, pharmacokinetic studies with 6-mercaptopurine have been conducted that are relevant to azathioprine. The mean relative bioavailability of 6-mercaptopurine was approximately 27% lower following administration with food and milk compared to an overnight fast. 6-mercaptopurine is not stable in milk due to the presence of xanthine oxidase (30% degradation within 30 minutes). Azathioprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach, but patients should standardise the method of administration. The dose should not be taken with milk or dairy products.After oral administration of [35S]-azathioprine, the maximum plasma radioactivity occurs at 1-2 hours and decays with a half-life of 4-6 hours. This is not an estimate of the half-life of azathioprine itself, but reflects the elimination from plasma of azathioprine and the [35S]-containing metabolites of the drug. Azathioprine is principally excreted as 6-thiouric uric acid in the urine. 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-thioimidazole has also been detected in urine as a minor excretory product. A small proportion of the drug may be cleaved between the S atom and the purine ring. Only a small amount of the dose of azathioprine administered is excreted unmetabolised in the urine.Biotransformation: Thiopurine S-Methyl Transferase (TPMT): TPMT activity is inversely related to red blood cell 6-mercaptopurine derived thioguanine nucleotide concentration, with higher thioguanine nucleotide concentrations resulting in greater reductions in white blood cell and neutrophil counts. Individuals with TPMT deficiency develop very high cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide concentrations.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
      "Interaction": "Allopurinol/oxipurinol/thiopurinol: When allopurinol, oxipurinol and/or thiopurinol are given concomitantly with 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine, the dose of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine should be reduced to 25% of the original dose.Neuromuscular blocking agents: There is considerable variation in the potency of interaction of Succinylcholine & tubocurarine with Azathioprine.Anticoagulants: Inhibits the effect of the anticoagulant of warfarin, when administered with azathioprine, has been reported.Cytostatic/myelosuppressive agents: Where possible, concomitant administration of cytostatic drugs, or drugs which may have a myelosuppressive effect, such as penicillamine, should be avoided. Methotrexate: When azathioprine is administered concomitantly with high dose methotrexate, the dose should be adjusted to maintain a suitable white blood cell count.Vaccines: The immunosuppressive activity of azathioprine could result in an atypical and potentially deleterious response to live vaccines and azathioprine therapy is contraindicated on theoretical grounds. A diminished response to killed vaccines is likely and such a response to hepatitis B vaccine has been observed among patients treated with a combination of azathioprine and corticosteroids.Ribavirin: Severe myelosuppression has been reported following concomitant administration of azathioprine and ribavirin; therefore co-administration is not advised.Other interactions: There is in vitro and in vivo evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g. olsalazine, mesalazine or sulphasalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme. Therefore, lower doses of azathioprine may need to be considered.",
      "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to azathioprine or to any of the excipients of this preparation. Hypersensitivity to 6-mercaptopurine should alert the prescriber to probable hypersensitivity to azathioprine.",
      "Side Effects": "For this product there is no modern clinical documentation that can be used as support for determining the frequency of undesirable effectsInfections and infestations: Very common: viral, fungal and bacterial infections in transplant patients receiving azathioprine in combination with other immunosuppressantsNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps): Rare: neoplasms including lymphoproliferative disorders, skin cancers (melanomas and non-melanomas), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ, acute myloid leukaemia and myelodysplasia Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Very common: depression of bone marrow function; leucopenia. Common: thrombocytopeniaImmune system disorders:Uncommon: hypersensitivity reactionsRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Very rareGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Teratogenicity: Evidence of the teratogenicity of azathioprine in man is equivocal. As with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, adequate contraceptive precautions should be advised when either partner is receiving azathioprine.Mutagenicity: Chromosomal abnormalities, which disappear with time, have been demonstrated in lymphocytes from the offspring of patients treated with azathioprine. Except in extremely rare cases, no overt physical evidence of abnormality has been observed in the offspring of patients treated with azathioprine. Azathioprine and long-wave ultraviolet light have been shown to have a synergistic clastogenic effect in patients treated with azathioprine for a range of disorders Fertility: The specific effect of azathioprine therapy on human fertility is unknown. Pregnancy: Substantial transplacental and trans amniotic transmission of azathioprine and its metabolites from the mother to the fetus has been shown to occur. Pregnancy Category D. Azathioprine should not be given to patients who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant in the near future without careful assessment of risk versus benefits. Evidence of the teratogenicity of azathioprine in man is equivocal. As with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, adequate contraceptive precautions should be advised when either partner is receiving azathioprine.Women of childbearing potential/contraception in men and women: Due to the genotoxic potential of azathioprine, women of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive measures while being treated with azathioprine and for one month following completion of treatment. Men are recommended to use effective contraceptive measures and to not father a child while receiving azathioprine and for three months following the completion of treatment.Lactation: It is recommended that mothers receiving azathioprine should not breastfeed. 6-Mercaptopurine has been identified in the colostrum and breast milk of women receiving azathioprine treatment",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Monitoring: There are potential hazards in the use of azathioprine. It should be prescribed only if the patient can be adequately monitored for toxic effects throughout the duration of therapy. It is suggested that during the first 8 weeks of therapy, complete blood counts, including platelets, should be performed weekly or more frequently if high dosage is used or if severe renal and/or hepatic disorder is present. The blood count frequency may be reduced later in therapy, but it is suggested that complete blood counts are repeated monthly, or at least at intervals of not longer than 3 months. At the first signs of an abnormal fall in blood counts, treatment should be interrupted immediately as leucocytes and platelets may continue to fall after treatment is stopped. Patients receiving azathioprine should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, unexpected bruising or bleeding or other manifestations of bone marrow depression. Bone marrow suppression is reversible if azathioprine is withdrawn early enough. There are individuals with an inherited deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) who may be unusually sensitive to the myelosuppressive effect of azathioprine and prone to developing rapid bone marrow depression following the initiation of treatment with azathioprine. This problem could be exacerbated by co-administration with drugs that inhibit TPMT, such as olsalazine, mesalazine or sulfasalazine. Also it has been reported that decreased TPMT activity increases the risk of secondary leukaemias and myelodysplasia in individuals receiving 6-mercaptopurine (the active metabolite of azathioprine) in combination with other cytotoxics. Some laboratories offer testing for TPMT deficiency, although these tests have not been shown to identify all patients at risk of severe toxicity. Therefore close monitoring of blood counts is still necessary. The dosage of azathioprine may need to be reduced when this agent is combined with other drugs whose primary or secondary toxicity is myelosuppression.Hepatotoxicity: Azathioprine is hepatotoxic and liver function tests should be routinely monitored during treatment.Renal and/or hepatic insufficiency: Caution is advised during the administration of azathioprine in patients with renal impairment and/or hepatic impairment. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: Mutagenicity: Chromosomal abnormalities have been demonstrated in both male and female patients treated with azathioprine. Effects on fertility: Relief of chronic renal insufficiency by renal transplantation involving the administration of azathioprine has been accompanied by increased fertility in both male and female transplant recipients.Carcinogenicity: Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including azathioprine are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the lymphoproliferative disorder.A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. Reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been received when azathioprine is used alone or in combination with anti-TNF agents or other immunosuppressants. Although most reported cases occurred in the IBD population, there have also been cases reported outside of this population.Patients receiving multiple immunosuppressive agents may be at risk of over-immunosuppression, therefore such therapy should be maintained at the lowest effective level. Photosensitivity and risk of skin cancer: Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited, and patients should wear protective clothing and use a sunscreen with a high protection factor, to minimize the risk of skin cancer and photosensitivity Varicella Zoster Virus Infection: Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV; chickenpox and herpes zoster) may become severe during the administration of immunosuppressants. Caution should be exercised.Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML, an opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus, has been reported in patients receiving azathioprine with other immunosuppressive agents. Immunosuppressive therapy should be withheld at the first sign or symptoms suggestive of PML and appropriate evaluation undertaken to establish a diagnosis.Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B carriers (defined as patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] for more than six months), or patients with documented past. HBV infection, who receive immunosuppressive drugs are at risk of reactivation of HBV replication, with asymptomatic increases in serum HBV DNA and ALT levels. Local guidelines may be considered including prophylactic therapy with oral anti-HBV agents.Macrophage activation syndrome: Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with the use of azathioprine.",

      "Indications": "Azilsartan Medoxomil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily stroke and myocardial infarction. Azilsartan Medoxomil may be used either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE, kinase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with efects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Azilsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting efects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathway for angiotensin II synthesis. An AT2 receptor is also found in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Azilsartan has more than a 10,000-fold greater afnity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction catalyzed by ACE. Because azilsartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase II), it should not afect bradykinin levels. Whether this diference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Azilsartan does not bind to or block other receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the efect of azilsartan on blood pressure.Azilsartan inhibits the pressor efects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner. An azilsartan single dose equivalent to 32 mg azilsartan medoxomil inhibited the maximal pressor efect by approximately 90% at peak, and approximately 60% at 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased after single and repeated administration of Azilsartan to healthy subjects; no clinically signifcant efects on serum potassium or sodium were observed.Absorption: Azilsartan medoxomil is hydrolyzed to azilsartan, the active metabolite, in the gastrointestinal tract during absorption. Azilsartan medoxomil is not detected in plasma after oral administration. Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. The estimated absolute bioavailability of azilsartan following administration of azilsartan medoxomil is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not afect the bioavailability of azilsartan.Distribution: The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16L. Azilsartan is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, minimal azilsartan-associated radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier. Azilsartan passed across the placental barrier in pregnant rats and was distributed to the fetus.Metabolism and Elimination: Azilsartan is metabolized to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O-dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of Azilsartan. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose in adults is 80 mg taken orally once daily. Consider a Starting dose of 40 mg for patients who are treated with high doses of diuretics. If blood pressure is not controlled with Azilsartan alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved by taking Azilsartan with other antihypertensive agents.",
      "Interaction": "No drug interactions have been observed in studies of Azilsartan Medoxomil or Azilsartan given with amlodipine, antacids, chlorthalidone, digoxin, fluconazole, glyburide, ketoconazole, metformin, pioglitazone and warfarin. The antihypertensive effect of Azilsartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia and changes in renal function.",
      "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated to co-administer Aliskiren with Azilsartan in patients with Diabetes.",
      "Side Effects": "The most common adverse reaction in adults is diarrhea. The other side effects are nausea, asthenia, fatigue, muscle spasm, dizziness and cough.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Azilsartan Medoxomil is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Azilsartan Medoxomil is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Use of Azilsartan Medoxomil during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Changes in renal function including renal failure has been reported in renal impaired patient.",

Azilsartan is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In whole blood, chlorthalidone is predominantly bound to erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase. In the plasma, approximately 75% of chlorthalidone is bound to plasma proteins, 58% of the drug being bound to albumin.Metabolism and Elimination: Azilsartan medoxomil: Azilsartan is metabolized to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O-dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I.

      "Indications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Azithromycin is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:\n\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nOther microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila\nAnaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",

      "Interaction": "Antacid: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should\u00a0be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic\u00a0interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of\u00a0carbamazepine or its active metabolite. Cyclosporin: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics\u00a0interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from\u00a0pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin\u00a0and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations\u00a0is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted\u00a0accordingly. Digoxin: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the\u00a0metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant\u00a0azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and\u00a0digoxin levels monitored. Ergot derivatives: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism,\u00a0azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. Methylprednisolone: In a\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on\u00a0the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. Theophylline: There is no evidence of any\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy\u00a0volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. Warfarin: In a\u00a0pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a\u00a0single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Azithromycin and warfarin may\u00a0be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely\u00a0performed. Terfenadine: Azithromycin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine\u00a0administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did\u00a0not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the\u00a0steady state dosing of terfenadine.",

The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",

This reparation is indicated to control pain and for use for surgical or endoscopic or other procedures in the ear, nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and esophagus. It may also be used for vaginal or rectal procedures when feasible.",
      "Composition": "Each 200 mg dose of this topical gel contains-\n\n28 mg of benzocaine\n4 mg of butamben and\n4 mg of tetracaine HCl",
      "Pharmacology": "The onset of this topical gel-produced anesthesia is rapid (approximately 30 seconds) and the duration of anesthesia is typically 30-60 minutes, when used as directed. This effect is due to the rapid onset, but short duration of action of Benzocaine coupled with the slow onset, but extended duration of Tetracaine HCI and bridged by the intermediate action of Butamben. It is believed that all of these agents act by reversibly blocking nerve conduction. Speed and duration of action is determined by the ability of the agent to be absorbed by the mucous membrane. It will be excreted in the urine after metabolism.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Dispense and apply 200 mg of gel (a bead approximately \u00bc to \u00bd inches long) by gently squeezing the tube.

This topical gel should not be used under dentures or cotton rolls, as retention of the active ingredients under a denture or cotton roll could possibly cause an escharotic effect. Routine precaution for the use of any topical anesthetic should be observed when using this topical gel.",
      "Side Effects": "Hypersensitivity Reactions: Unpredictable adverse reactions (i.e. hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis) are extremely rare. Localized allergic reactions may occur after prolonged or repeated use of any aminobenzoate anesthetic. The most common adverse reaction caused by local anesthetics is contact dermatitis characterized by erythema and pruritus that may progress to vesiculation and oozing. This occurs most commonly in patients following prolonged self-medication, which is contraindicated. If rash, urticaria, edema, or other manifestations of allergy develop during use, the drug should be discontinued. To minimize the possibility of a serious allergic reaction, this topical gel preparations should not be applied for prolonged periods except under continual supervision. Dehydration of the epithelium or an escharotic effect may also result from prolonged contact.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Acne vulgaris is caused by inflammation in the pilosebaceous gland. Acne is generally caused by increased excretion of sebum from pilosebaceous glands, endocrine factors such as androgenic hormones, keratin developing around follicles, bacterial growth, and inflammation. These factors contribute to the formation of comedones (whiteheads and blackheads). The peroxide bond of benzoyl peroxide is cleaved to form 2 benzoyloxy radicals. These radicals interact nonspecifically with bacterial proteins, interfering with their function, and survival of the bacteria. Over time, free radical interactions with bacterial proteins lead to decreased keratin and sebum around follicles. Benzoyl peroxide can also increase the turnover rate of epithelial cells, leading to skin peeling, and breaking down comedones.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Shake well before using. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with Benzoyl Peroxide, washing the affected areas once a day during the first week, and twice a day thereafter as tolerated.

Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:\u03b2 carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with \u03b2 carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",

      "Pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this\u00a0tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.",
      "Interaction": "Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of \u03b2 carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
      "Contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
      "Side Effects": "\u03b2 carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "\u03b2 carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "There are some evidences that \u03b2 carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.",

      "name": "Betahistine Dihydrochloride",
      "generic_id": "121",
      "Indications": "Meniere's disease and Meniere-like syndromes are characterized by attacks of vertigo, tinnitus and/or progressive loss of hearing, usually accompanied by nausea and vomiting.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "The mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Meniere's disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear. Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: Initial oral treatment is 8 to 16mg three times daily, taken preferably with meals. Maintenance doses are generally in the range 24-48 mg daily. Daily dose should not exceed 48mg. Dosage can be adjusted to suit individual patient needs. Sometimes improvement could be observed only after a couple of weeks of treatment. There is no data available for patients with hepatic impairment. There is no data available for patients with renal impairment. There is limited data in the elderly, betahistine should be used with caution in this population.Children and adolescents: Betahistine tablets are not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.",
      "Interaction": "There are no proven cases of hazardous interactions. There is a case report of an\u00a0interaction with ethanol and a compound containing pyrimethamine with dapsone and another of\u00a0potentiation of betahistine with salbutamol. Betahistine is a histamine analogue, concurrent\u00a0administration of H1 antagonists may cause a mutual attenuation of effect of the active agents.",
      "Contraindications": "Betahistine is contraindicated in patients with phaeochromocytoma. As betahistine is a synthetic analogue of histamine it may induce the release of catecholamines from the tumour resulting in severe hypertension. Hypersensitivity to the active substance.",
      "Side Effects": "Betahistine is generally well tolerated and there is no known serious adverse effects. In some circumstances gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, rashes and pruritus have been reported.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "In Pregnancy: The safety of Betahistine in human pregnancy has not been completely established, although there is no known teratogenic effect in animals. A careful assessment of potential benefits should be made before prescribing Betahistine in pregnancy.In Lactation: Betahistine is excreted in the breast milk of nursing mothers in concentrations similar to those found in plasma. Toxicity to the neonate at these concentrations is not known.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Caution is advised in the treatment of patients with peptic ulcer or a history of peptic ulceration, because of the occasional dyspepsia encountered in patients on betahistine. Caution should be exercised in patients with bronchial asthma. Caution is advised in prescribing betahistine to patients with either urticaria, rashes or allergic rhinitis, because of the possibility of aggravating these symptoms. Caution is advised in patients with severe hypotension. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Rare reports of drowsiness associated with betahistine have been made. Patients should be advised that they are affected in this way they should avoid activities requiring concentration, such as driving and operating machinery.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Betahistine Mesilate dilates precapillary sphincters, increasing the blood flow in the inner ear. It controls the permeability of capillaries in the inner ear, thereby removing endolymphatic hydrops. It also improves cerebral circulation, increasing blood flow in the internal carotid artery. Thus, Betahistine Mesylate is clinically useful for the relief of vertigo and dizziness.Betahistine Mesilate increases microcirculation blood flow in the inner ear, and removes endolymphatic hydrops of the inner ear. It also significantly increases the blood flow of the internal carotid artery. For discomfort accompanying cerebral disturbances: Betahistine exhibits a marked healing effect on giddiness experienced upon standing, the sensation of instability, and symptoms of dizziness. The heavy feeling in the head and the accompanying discomforts can also be successfully subdued. For dizziness and the sensation of dizziness due to disturbances in the inner ear: Betahistine improves microcirculation of the inner ear and removes endolymph hydrops, thereby alleviating dizziness in Meniere's disease and Meniere's syndrome. Tinnitus, the sensation of ear obstructions, nausea and vomiting are also effectively allayed. For the prevention of dizzy spells and other residual symptoms: Along with inhibiting the symptoms of dizziness and removing residual symptoms after the attack, continued administration of Betahistine Mesylate also prevents the recurrence of dizzy spells.

These effects can be enhanced under occlusive conditions due to increased penetration of stratum corneum (by approximately a factor of 10). Calcipotriol is a non-steroidal antipsoriatic agent, derived from vitamin D. Calcipotriol exhibits a vitamin D-like effect by competing for the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor. Calcipotriol is as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3, the naturally occurring active form of vitamin D, in regulating cell proliferation and cell differentiation, but much less active than 1,25(OH)2D3 in its effect on calcium metabolism. Calcipotriol induces differentiation and suppresses proliferation (without any evidence of a cytotoxic effect) of keratinocytes, thus reversing the abnormal keratinocyte changes in psoriasis. The therapeutic goal envisaged with Calcipotriol is thus a normalization of epidermal growth.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Topical Ointment: This Ointment is indicated for topical use only. The phototoxic effects have not been studied in psoriasis patients. All psoriasis-affected areas treated with this Ointment should be, where possible, protected from direct sunlight and UV-light with items of clothing.\n\nAdults: This ointment should be applied topically to the affected area once daily.

It induces phospholipase A2 inhibitory lipase (lipocortins) and sequentially inhibits the release of arachidonic acid, thereby depressing the formation, release, and activity of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators.Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic with mainly direct effects on alpha-adrenergic receptors and weak beta-adrenergic activity. It causes vasoconstriction of the arterioles of the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva; activates the dilator muscle of the pupil to cause contraction; produces vasoconstriction of arterioles in the body and produces systemic arterial vasoconstriction.Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "A course of treatment should be limited to 7 days.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Betaxolol is a selective (beta-1-adrenergic) receptor blocking agent that does not have significant membrane stabilizing (local anesthetic) activity and is free from intrinsic sympathomimetic action. When instilled into the eye, Betaxolol reduces elevated as well as normal intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Optic nerve head damage and visual field loss are results of a sustained elevated intraocular pressure and poor ocular perfusion. The ocular hypotensive action of Betaxolol appears to be mediated by a reduction of aqueous production as demonstrated by tonography and aqueous flurophotometry. Betaxolol ophthalmic solution does not produce miosis or accommodative spasm which is frequently seen with miotic. The onset of action with Betaxolol can generally be noted within 30 minutes and the maximal effect can usually be detected two hours after topical administration. A single dose provides a 12-hour reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and twice daily administration maintains the IOP below 22 mm Hg in most patients.",

In some patients, the intraocular pressure-lowering response may require a few weeks to stabilize. Clinical follow-up should include a determination of the intraocular pressure during the first month of treatment. Thereafter, intraocular pressure should be determined on an individual basis at the judgment of the physician.0.25% ophthalmic solution: The recommended dose is one to two drops of Betaxolol Hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily.Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.",
      "Interaction": "Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and Betaxolol Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution should be observed for a potential additive effect either on the intraocular pressure or on the known systemic effects of beta blockade. Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or bradycardia. Caution should be exercised in patients using concomitant adrenergic psychotropic drugs. In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, the immediate treatment objective is to reopen the angle by constriction of the pupil with a miotic agent. Betaxolol has little or no effect on the pupil. When Betaxolol Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is used to reduce elevated intraocular pressure in angle-closure glaucoma, it should be used with a miotic and not alone.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Bethanechol acts principally by producing the effects of stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system. It increases the tone of the detrusor urinae muscle, usually producing a contraction sufficiently strong to initiate micturition and empty the bladder. It stimulates gastric motility, increases gastric tone, and often restores rhythmic peristalsis. Stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine at the nerve endings. When spontaneous stimulation is reduced and therapeutic intervention is required, acetylcholine can be given, but it is rapidly hydrolyzed by cholinesterase, and its effects are transient. Bethanechol is not destroyed by cholinesterase and its effects are more prolonged and predictable than those of acetylcholine. It has predominant muscarinic action and only feeble nicotinic action. Doses that stimulate micturition and defecation and increase peristalsis do not ordinarily stimulate ganglia or voluntary muscles. Therapeutic test doses in normal human subjects have little effect on heart rate, blood pressure, or peripheral circulation.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Dosage must be individualized, depending on the type and severity of the condition to be treated. Preferably give the drug when the stomach is empty. If taken soon after eating, nausea and vomiting may occur. The usual adult oral dose ranges from 10 to 50 mg three or four times a day. The minimum effective dose is determined by giving 5 to 10 mg initially and repeating the same amount at hourly intervals until satisfactory response occurs, or until a maximum of 50 mg has been given.

It isalso not known whether bethanechol chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Bethanechol chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from bethanechol chloride in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Special care and consideration are required when bethanechol is administered to patients being treated concomitantly with other drugs with which pharmacologic interactions may occur. Examples of drugs with potentials for such interactions are: quinidine and procainamide, which may antagonize cholinergic effects; cholinergic drugs, particularly cholinesterase inhibitors, where additive effects may occur. When administered to patients receiving ganglionic blocking compounds a critical fall in blood pressure may occur which usually is preceded by severe abdominal symptoms. In urinary retention, if the sphincter fails to relax as bethanechol contracts the bladder, urine may be forced up the ureter into the kidney pelvis. If there is bacteriuria, this may cause reflux infection.",

The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg. Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role. Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Adult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction",
      "Interaction": "Other \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisoprolol Fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisoprolol fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.",
      "Contraindications": "In patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.",
      "Side Effects": "Medicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.",
      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Impaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisoprolol in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.",

      "Indications": "This combination tablet is indicated for the treatment of hypertension as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with the individual products given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination, but as separate tablets.",
      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine acts directly on vessels to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.Bisoprolol Fumarate is a synthetic, beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic and relevant membrane stabilizing activity. It only shows low affinity to the beta2 receptor of the smooth muscles of bronchi and vessels as well as to the beta2-receptors concerned with metabolic regulation. Therefore, bisoprolol is generally not to be expected to influence airway resistance and beta2-mediated metabolic effects. Its beta1-selectivity extends beyond the therapeutic dose range.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "One tablet once daily in patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled with separately administered monocomponent products of the same doses as the recommended fixed-dose combination.",

      "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy and Lactation: Not recommended.",
      "Precautions & Warnings": "Patients with heart failure should be treated with caution. An increased risk of a further deterioration of the ventricular pump function cannot be excluded. Since the abrupt withdrawal of bisoprolol may lead to a transitory worsening of the clinical condition, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease, the treatment must not be stopped abruptly. Caution is advised in patients with impaired hepatic function. Beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with obstructive airways diseases unless there are compelling clinical reasons for their use. Due to the bisoprolol component treatment must be used with caution in: bronchospasm (bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease; concomitant bronchodilating therapy may be recommended); diabetes mellitus showing large fluctuations in blood glucose values, symptoms of hypoglycemia can be masked; strict fasting; ongoing desensitization therapy; first degree AV block; Prinzmetal\u2019s angina; peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Patients with psoriasis or with a history of psoriasis should only be given beta-blockers (e.g. bisoprolol) after a careful balancing of benefits and risks. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis may be masked. In patients undergoing general anesthesia, the anesthetist must be aware of beta-blockade. If it is thought necessary to withdraw beta blocker therapy before surgery, this should be done gradually and completed about 48 hours before anesthesia.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a \u03b21-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Bisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using Bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component. Initial Therapy: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of this conbination, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with this tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg once daily, as appropriate. Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components. Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg Bisoprolol daily may instead be given this conbination. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to this conbination.",
      "Interaction": "This combination drug may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. This combination drug should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol Fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that this combination drug be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. This combination drug should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes) or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.",

      "Pharmacology": "Bivalirudin directly inhibits thrombin by specifically binding both to the catalytic site and to the anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site functions.In in vitro studies, bivalirudin inhibited both soluble (free) and clot-bound thrombin, was not neutralized by products of the platelet release reaction, and prolonged the activated partialthromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration-dependent manner.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Bortezomib for Injection is an antineoplastic agent available for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous injection use. It is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that Bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.Distribution: The distribution volume of Bortezomib as a single agent was not assessed at the recommended dose in patients with multiple myeloma.The binding of Bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL.Metabolism: Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized via cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A4, 2C19, and 1 A2. Bortezomib metabolism by CYP 2D6 and 2C9 enzymes is minor. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form 2 deboronated metabolites that subsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. Deboronated Bortezomib metabolites are inactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors.Elimination: The mean elimination half-life of Bortezomib after first dose ranged from 9 to 15 hours at doses ranging from 1.45 to 2.00 mg/m2 in patients with advanced malignancies. The pathways of elimination of Bortezomib have not been characterized in humans.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of Bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2/dose administered as a 3 to 5 second bolus intravenous and subcutaneous injection twice weekly for 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a 10-day rest period (Days 12-21). For extended therapy of more than 8 cycles, Bortezomib may be administered on the standard schedule or on a maintenance schedule of once weekly for 4 weeks (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) followed by a 13-day rest period (Days 23 to 35).Bortezomib retreatment may be considered for patients with multiple myeloma who has previously responded to treatment with Bortezomib and who has relapsed at least 6 months after completing prior Bortezomib treatment. Treatment may be started at the last tolerated dose. Bortezomib is for intravenous or subcutaneous use only. Bortezomib should not be administered by any other route.",

Bortezomib may inhibit 2C19 activity (IC50= 18 \u00b5M, 6.9 \u00b5g/mL) and increase exposure to drugs that are substrates for this enzyme. Bortezomib did not induce the activities of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 1A2 in primary cultured human hepatocytes.",
      "Contraindications": "Bortezomib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Bortezomib, boron or mannitol. Reactions have included anaphylactic reactions.

      "Precautions & Warnings": "Bortezomib should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic therapy.Peripheral Neuropathy: Bortezomib treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory, although cases of motor neuropathy have also been reported. Patients with preexisting symptoms (numbness, pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy (including > Grade 3) during treatment with Bortezomib. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort or neuropathic pain. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require changes in thedose and schedule of Bortezomib. Starting Bortezomib subcutaneously may be considered for patients with pre-existing or at high risk of peripheral neuropathy.The long-term outcome of peripheral neuropathy has not been studied in mantle cell lymphoma.Hypotension: Caution should be used when treating patients with a history of syncope, patients receiving medications known to be associated with hypotension, and patients who are dehydrated. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension may include adjustment of antihypertensive medications, hydration, and administration of mineralocorticoids and/or sympathomimetics.Cardiac Disorders: The acute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure has been seen in patients with risk factors for, or existing heart disease. Such patients should be closely monitored. In clinical studies, isolated cases of QT-interval prolongation have been observed; causality has not been established.Gastrointestinal Adverse Events: Bortezomib treatment can cause nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting with sometimes requiring use of antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications. Fluid and electrolyte replacement should be administered to prevent dehydration.Pulmonary Toxicity: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown etiology such as pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, and lung infiltration have occurred in patients receiving Bortezomib. Some of these events have been fatal. There have been reports of pulmonary hypertension associated with Bortezomib administration in the absence of left heart failure or significant pulmonary disease. In the event of new or worsening cardiopulmonary symptoms, consider interrupting Bortezomib until a prompt and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is conducted.Thrombocytopenia: Bortezomib is associated with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that follow a cyclical pattern with nadirs occurring following the last dose of each cycle and typically recovering prior to initiation of the subsequent cycle. The cyclical pattern of platelet and neutrophil decreases and recovery remain consistent in the studies of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, with no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in the treatment regimens studied. Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently during treatment with Bortezomib. Measure platelet counts prior to each dose of Bortezomib. Adjust dose/schedule for thrombocytopenia. There have been reports of gastrointestinal and intracerebral hemorrhage in association with Bortezomib. Transfusions may be considered.Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with Bortezomib therapy. Patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Monitor patients closely and take appropriate precautions.Hepatic Toxicity: Cases of acute liver failure have been reported in patients receiving multiple concomitant medications and with serious underlying medical conditions. Other reported hepatic reactions include hepatitis, increases in liver enzymes, and hyperbilirubinemia. Interrupt Bortezomib therapy to assess reversibility.

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Bosentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with affinity for both endothelin A and B (ETA and ETB) receptors. Bosentan decreases both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance resulting in increased cardiac output without increasing heart rate. The neurohormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors known and can also promote fibrosis, cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling, and is pro-inflammatory. These effects are mediated by endothelin binding to ETA and ETB receptors located in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. ET-1 concentrations in tissues and plasma are increased in several cardiovascular disorders and connective tissue diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, scleroderma, acute and chronic heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension and atherosclerosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of ET-1 in these diseases. In pulmonary arterial hypertension and heart failure, in the absence of endothelin receptor antagonism, elevated ET-1 concentrations are strongly correlated with the severity and prognosis of these diseases.Absorption: In healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability of bosentan is approximately 50% and is not affected by food. The maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 3-5 hours.Distribution: Bosentan is highly bound (>98%) to plasma proteins, mainly albumin.Elimination:\u00a0Bosentan is eliminated by biliary excretion following metabolism in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Less than 3% of an administered oral dose is recovered in urine.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "Tablets are to be taken orally morning and evening, with or without food.Pulmonary arterial hypertension: ln adult patients, Bosentan treatment should be initiated at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then increased to the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily.For paediatric patients aged 2 years or older, the optimal maintenance dose has not been defined in well-controlled studies. However, paediatric pharmacokinetic data have shown that Bosentan plasma concentrations in children were on average lower than in adult patients and were not increased by increasing the dose of Bosentan above 2 mg/kg body weight twice daily.Discontinuation of treatment: lf the decision to withdraw Bosentan is taken, it should be done gradually while an alternative therapy is introduced.",

      "Composition": "Not available",
      "Pharmacology": "Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity at clinically achievable concentrations against multiple kinases including ALK, ROS1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and FLT-3 as well as EGFR deletion and point mutations. Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3, AKT, ERK1/2, and S6 in in-vitro and in vivo assays. Brigatinib also inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice.\u00a0Brigatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of the pharmacodynamic response are unknown.Absorption: Following administration of single oral doses of Brigatinib of 30 to 240 mg, the median time to peak concentration (Tmax) ranged from 1 to 4 hours.Distribution: Brigatinib is 66% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is not concentration-dependent in vitro. The blood to plasma concentration ratio is 0.69. Following oral administration of Brigatinib 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of Brigatinib at steady-state was 153 L.Elimination: Following oral administration of Brigatinib 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of Brigatinib at steady-state is 12.7 L/h and the mean plasma elimination half-life is 25 hours.Metabolism: Brigatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled Brigatinib to healthy subjects, N-demethylation and cysteine conjugation were the two major metabolic pathways. Unchanged Brigatinib (92%) and its primary metabolite, AP26123 (3.5%), were the major circulating radioactive components. The steady-state AUC of AP26123 was less than 10% of AUC of Brigatinib exposure in patients. The metabolite, AP26123, inhibited ALK with approximately 3-fold lower potency than Brigatinib in vitro.Excretion: Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled Brigatinib to healthy subjects, 65% of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 25% of the administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged Brigatinib represented 41% and 86% of the total radioactivity in feces and urine, respectively.",
      "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dosing regimen for Brigatinib is:\n\n90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days;\nIf 90 mg is tolerated during the first 7 days, the dose should be increased to 180 mg orally once daily.\n\r\nBrigatinib should be administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If Brigatinib is interrupted for 14 days or longer for reasons other than adverse reactions, treatment should be resumed at 90 mg once daily for 7 days before increasing to the previously tolerated dose. Brigatinib may be taken with or without food. Patients should be instructed to swallow tablets whole. Tablets should not be crushed or chewed. If a dose of Brigatinib is missed or vomiting occurs after taking a dose, an additional dose should not be administered and take the next dose of Brigatinib should be taken at the scheduled time.Pediatric Use: The safety and efficacy of Brigatinib in pediatric patients have not been established.",
      "Interaction": "Drugs that may Increase Brigatinib Plasma Concentrations: Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased Brigatinib plasma concentrations and may result in increased adverse reactions.
