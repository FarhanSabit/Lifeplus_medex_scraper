It is widely distributed to most tissues and appears in breast milk. Within the cell, thiamine is mostly present as diphosphate. Thiamine is not stored to any appreciable extent in the body and amounts in excess of the body\u2019s requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged thiamine or as metabolites. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the GIT following oral administration and are converted to the active forms of pyridoxal phosphate an pyridoxamine phosphate. They are stored mainly in liver where there is oxidation to 4-pyridoxic acid and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted in urine.

    "generic_id": "7695",
    "Indications": "3-C is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections:\u00a0e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-C is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: \n\n6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily\nChildren 1-4 years: 5 ml daily\nChildren 5-10 years: 10 ml daily\n\nIn typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
    "Interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "3-C is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-C are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "3-C should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-C, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-C should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-C should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Third generation Cephalosporins",

It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "3-C should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-C, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-C should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-C should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",

It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections:\u00a0e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-Geocef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: \n\n6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily\nChildren 1-4 years: 5 ml daily\nChildren 5-10 years: 10 ml daily\n\nIn typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
    "Interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "3-Geocef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-Geocef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported.

    "Indications": "Vitamin D3 deficiency can occur in people whose exposure to sunlight is limited and in those whose diet is deficient in vitamin D3.\nVitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth, preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis.\nVitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant.\nVitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.",
    "Pharmacology": "The active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.",

    "generic_id": "7699",
    "Indications": "3RD Cef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections:\u00a0e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3RD Cef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: \n\n6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily\nChildren 1-4 years: 5 ml daily\nChildren 5-10 years: 10 ml daily\n\nIn typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
    "Interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "3RD Cef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3RD Cef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "3RD Cef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3RD Cef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3RD Cef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3RD Cef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Third generation Cephalosporins",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep below 30\u00baC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

    "Indications": "3RD Cef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI): e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.Urinary Tract Infections:\u00a0e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3RD Cef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: \n\n6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily\nChildren 1-4 years: 5 ml daily\nChildren 5-10 years: 10 ml daily\n\nIn typhoid: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.Dosage in Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
    "Interaction": "In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "3RD Cef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3RD Cef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "3RD Cef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3RD Cef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3RD Cef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3RD Cef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Third generation Cephalosporins",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep below 30\u00baC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

    "Pharmacology": "Fluorouracil is inactive as such in mammalian cells but is converted into the active 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) by a variety of different metabolic pathways. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus of DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 and S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell cycle.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Intravenous 5-fluorouracil can be delivered by rapid intravenous bolus injection or slow infusion. The vial contents can rapidly be injected directly into a peripheral vein, the commonest schedules being: 12-13.5 mg/Kg (500 mg/m2) daily for 5 days repeated at 4-weekly intervals. Slow intravenous infusion requires the drug, to be diluted in 500 ml of dextrose 5% solution, then infused over 2-3 hr on 5 successive days.For palliative management of cancer: Initial Dose: 12 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days. Maximum Dose: 800 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 6 mg/kg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7, 9, or 11). Discontinue at the end of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity.Poor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state: Initial Dose: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Maximum Dose: 400 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 3 mg/kg may be administered on days 5, 7, and 9 (No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end of day 9, even with no apparent toxicity.Maintenance therapy: In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules:\n\nRepeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course, or\nWhen the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Maximum Dose: 1g/week .The reaction by the patient to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nUsual adult dose for cervical cancer: In combination with cisplatin 1 gm/m2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every 21 days.Usual pediatric dose for malignant disease: The manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines.Intra-arterial infusion: Fluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5% Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump.Combination with radiation: Usual adult daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.Combination with other anticancer drugs: Fluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of breast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant neoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of breast cancer. A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily is given in combination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to twice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.",
    "Interaction": "Pre-treatment with cimetidine for 4 weeks led to increased plasma concentrations of 5 FU PhaRes following intravenous and oral administration in 6 patients. The effect was probably due to a combination of hepatic enzyme inhibition and reduced hepatic blood flow.",
    "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients that are severely debilitated or in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It should also be avoided in patients that do not have malignant illnesses.",
    "Side Effects": "Potentially life-threatening effects: Severe effects from 5-5 FU PhaRes are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.Cardiac effects: Occasional case reports associating 5-5 FU PhaRes therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.Hematological effects: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-5 FU PhaRes on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-5 FU PhaRes.Neurological effects: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5 FU PhaRes. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "5-5 FU PhaRes is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools). Gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding.",

    "Indications": "5-Fluril is indicated alone or in combination for-\u00a0 \n\nCarcinoma of the colon or rectum\nCarcinoma of the stomach and exocrine pancreas\nCarcinoma of the liver\nCarcinoma of the breast\nCarcinoma of the bladder\nCarcinoma of the lung\nEpithelial ovarian carcinoma\nCervical carcinoma.",
    "Pharmacology": "Fluorouracil is inactive as such in mammalian cells but is converted into the active 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) by a variety of different metabolic pathways. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus of DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 and S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell cycle.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Intravenous 5-fluorouracil can be delivered by rapid intravenous bolus injection or slow infusion. The vial contents can rapidly be injected directly into a peripheral vein, the commonest schedules being: 12-13.5 mg/Kg (500 mg/m2) daily for 5 days repeated at 4-weekly intervals. Slow intravenous infusion requires the drug, to be diluted in 500 ml of dextrose 5% solution, then infused over 2-3 hr on 5 successive days.For palliative management of cancer: Initial Dose: 12 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days. Maximum Dose: 800 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 6 mg/kg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7, 9, or 11). Discontinue at the end of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity.Poor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state: Initial Dose: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Maximum Dose: 400 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 3 mg/kg may be administered on days 5, 7, and 9 (No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end of day 9, even with no apparent toxicity.Maintenance therapy: In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules:\n\nRepeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course, or\nWhen the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Maximum Dose: 1g/week .The reaction by the patient to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nUsual adult dose for cervical cancer: In combination with cisplatin 1 gm/m2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every 21 days.Usual pediatric dose for malignant disease: The manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines.Intra-arterial infusion: Fluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5% Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump.Combination with radiation: Usual adult daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.Combination with other anticancer drugs: Fluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of breast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant neoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of breast cancer. A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily is given in combination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to twice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.",
    "Interaction": "Pre-treatment with cimetidine for 4 weeks led to increased plasma concentrations of 5-Fluril following intravenous and oral administration in 6 patients. The effect was probably due to a combination of hepatic enzyme inhibition and reduced hepatic blood flow.",
    "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients that are severely debilitated or in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It should also be avoided in patients that do not have malignant illnesses.",
    "Side Effects": "Potentially life-threatening effects: Severe effects from 5-5-Fluril are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.Cardiac effects: Occasional case reports associating 5-5-Fluril therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.Hematological effects: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-5-Fluril on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-5-Fluril.Neurological effects: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5-Fluril. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "5-5-Fluril is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools). Gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding.",

It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of 5X within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.Fertility Following Use: A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with 5X for emergency contraception. So, to prevent pregnancy on a later episode of sexual intercourse one should use the barrier method (ex. Condom).Effect on Menstrual Cycle: After 5X intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. 7% of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, a pregnancy test should be performed. 9% of women studied reported intermenstrual bleeding after the use of 5X.",

Supplementary A-B1 may be indicated prophylactically in conditions where there is low dietary intake or impaired gastro intestinal absorption of thiamine (e.g. alcohol) or where requirements are increased (pregnancy, carbohydrate rich diet).",
    "Pharmacology": "Thiamine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B1) is an essential constituent for the metabolism of carbohydrate and a lot of amino acids. Utilization of pyruvic acid and amino acid in tissue are decreased in Thiamine deficiency. So pyruvic acid and lactic acid are accumulated and cause Beri-beri. In adult, approximately 1 mg of Thiamine per day is completely degraded by the tissues, and this is roughly the minimal daily requirement. Thiamine is well absorbed from the Gastro-intestinal tract and is widely distributed to most body tissues. Excess of the body requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged or as metabolites.",

Read more250 mg or 500 mg tablet: A-Cal tablet is used for the treatment or prevention of calcium depletion in patients in whom dietary measures are inadequate. Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Calcium Carbonate is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Calcium Carbonate containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.1000 mg tablet: A-Cal tablet is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.",
    "Pharmacology": "Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO3+2HCl = CaCl2+H2O+CO2. Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion. Up to 30% of the oral calcium load may be absorbed.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "250 mg or 500 mg tablet: Calcium Carbonate is always used orally and when used as an antacid the recommended doses for adults are equivalent to 540-2000 mg Calcium Carbonate per day, doses for children being half of those for adults. As a dietary supplement, such as for the prevention of osteoporosis, 1250-3750 mg Calcium Carbonate (500-1500 mg calcium) daily is recommended in general, but again this will need to be tailored to the individual patient depending on any specific disease such as Calcium deficiency, malabsorption or parathyroid function. In pregnancy and lactation the recommended daily dose of calcium is 1200-1500 mg. In chronic renal failure the doses used vary from 2.5-9.0 gm Calcium Carbonate per day and need to be adjusted according to the individual patient. To maximize effective phosphate binding in this context the Calcium Carbonate should be given with meals.1000 mg tablet: 2000-3000 mg tablet when symptoms occur; may be repeated hourly if needed or as directed by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "Calcium Carbonate may enhance the cardiac effects of digoxin and other cardiac glycosides, if systemic hypercalcaemia occurs. Calcium Carbonate may interfere with the absorption of concomitantly administered tetracycline preparations and in chronic renal failure modification of vitamin D therapy may be required to avoid hypercalcaemia when Calcium Carbonate is used as the primary phosphate binder.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism\nHypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome\nConcomitant digoxin therapy (requires careful monitoring of serum calcium level)\n\r\nWhen hypercalcaemia occurs, discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to return serum calcium concentrations to normal. Calcium salts should be used cautiously in patients with sarcoidosis, renal or cardiac disease, and in patients receiving cardiac glycosides.",
    "Side Effects": "Orally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcaemia is rarely produced by administration of calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Calcium containing drugs have been widely used in pregnancy by way of oral calcium supplementation or antacid therapy. Calcium Carbonate can be used in lactating women too.",

    "Indications": "A-Card is indicated for the prevention and treatment of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. The onset of action of oral A-Card is not sufficiently rapid for A-Card to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.",
    "Pharmacology": "Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate. The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and\u00a0 pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction and coronary dilatation remains undefined.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Tablet: The usual oral dose is 1 tablet (20 mg) 2 times daily, first dose in the morning and another 7 hours apart. Although maintenance doses ranging from 20 mg to 120 mg (1-6 tablets), a dose of 10 mg (1/2 tablet) is suitable when lower dosage is used at the starting of treatment or as directed by a registered physician.Sustained Release Capsule: The usual oral dose is 1 capsule (50 mg) daily or as directed by the registered physician.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant use of A-Card with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated.\nConcomitant use of A-Card with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated.\nThe vasodilating effects of A-Card may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety.\nMarked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary.",
    "Contraindications": "Isosorbide mononitrate is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking certain drugs for erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase inhibitors), such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension.",
    "Side Effects": "Headache, feelings of dizziness, hypotension may occur sometimes.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 540 and 810 mg/kg/day, respectively, have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to isosorbide mononitrate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Isosorbide Mononitrate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether isosorbide mononitrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when isosorbide mononitrate is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of A-Card. A-Card should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by A-Card may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of oral A-Card is not known.Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of A-Card tablets can be maintained by carefully following the prescribed schedule of dosing (two doses taken seven hours apart). For most patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later.As with other nitrates, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with A-Card. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with A-Card, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve A-Card-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on A-Card\u2019s antianginal efficacy.Treatment with A-Card may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.",

Read moreAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:\u03b2 carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with \u03b2 carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
    "Pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this\u00a0tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of \u03b2 carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
    "Contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
    "Side Effects": "\u03b2 carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "\u03b2 carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "There are some evidences that \u03b2 carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.",

    "Storage Conditions": "Should be stored in a dry place below 30\u02daC."

    "Composition": "Each 5 ml syrup contains-\n\nDextromethorphan Hydrobromide BP 20 mg\nPhenylephrine Hydrochloride BP 10 mg\nTriprolidine Hydrochloride BP 2.5 mg",
    "Pharmacology": "This preparation is a mixture of antitussive, decongestant and antihistamine agent. Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. Phenylephrine is used for the temporary relief of stuffy nose, sinus, and ear symptoms caused by the common cold, flu, allergies, sinusitis & bronchitis. This medication works by decreasing swelling in the nose and ears, thereby lessening discomfort and making it easier to breathe. Triprolidine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. These symptoms include rash, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat/skin, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness. By antagonizing another natural substance acetylcholine, it helps dry up some body fluids to relieve symptoms such as watery eyes and runny nose.",

    "Pharmacology": "The mechanism of action of Diclofenac Potassium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: Following an initial loading dose of 50 mg, 25-50 mg is to be taken every eight hours if necessary.Migraine: An initial loading dose of 50 mg, then if necessary a further 25-50 mg after 2 hours.

    "Contraindications": "Diclofenac Potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Diclofenac. Diclofenac should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients. Diclofenac is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.",
    "Side Effects": "Side-effects of A-Fenac K are usually mild and transient. However, if serious side-effects occur. A-Fenac K should be discontinued.

Therefore the possibility of pain at the injection site, which is most likely to occur after intramuscular injection, is minimized if the Lidocaine containing injection is used in the above indications.",
    "Pharmacology": "Diclofenac Sodium is a potent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked analgesic and antipyretic properties. It also has some uricosuric effects. The action of Diclofenac appeared to be associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Diclofenac may inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyses the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid. Peak plasma concentration is achieved within half an hour following injection. Lidocaine is the most widely used local anaesthetic drug. It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic. Like other local anaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and conduction of nerve impulses by slowing depolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine Hydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 hours.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult: One ampoule once (or in severe cases, twice) daily by intramuscular injection.Renal colic: One ampoule once daily intramuscularly. A second dose may be administered after 30 minutes if necessary.Children: In Juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac Sodium per kg body weight daily in divided doses.Elderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status, or as prescribed by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "Lithium and Digoxin: Diclofenac may increase plasma concentrations of Lithium and Digoxin. Anticoagulants: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of Diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect. Antidiabetic agents: Clinical studies have shown that Diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect. Cyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Cyclosporin and Diclofenac concomitantly. Methotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when Methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other. Quinolone antimicrobials: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAIDs and quinolones. Other NSAIDs and steroids: Co-administration of Diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With Aspirin, the plasma levels of each are lowered, although no clinical significance is known. Diuretics: Various NSAIDs are liable to inhibit the activity of diuretics. Concomitant treatment with potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. So, serum potassium should be monitored.",
    "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by Aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibiting activity Diclofenac is also contraindicated. Because of the presence of Lidocaine, this\u00a0injection is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. In patients with Adams-Stokes syndrome or with severe degrees of SA, AV, or intraventricular heart block in the absence of an artificial pacemaker, and for those patients who are hypersensitive to any of the excipients used in the formulation (Sodium Metabisulphite, Disodium Edetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol), this injection is also contraindicated.",
    "Side Effects": "Side effects to Diclofenac Sodium and Lidocaine injection are usually mild and transient. However if serious side effects occur the injection should be discontinued. Gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea and occasionally bleeding may occur. In very rare instances, injection site disorder may occur. In isolated cases, abscesses and local necrosis may occur. The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly involve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are dose related. The CNS reactions may be manifested by drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lightheadedness etc.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "It should not be prescribed during pregnancy unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. The lowest effective dosage should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the last trimester of pregnancy. Very small quantities of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk, but no undesirable effects on the infant are to be expected.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Renal: Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly should be kept under close observation, since the use of NSAIDs may result in deterioration of renal function. The lowest effective dose should be used and renal function should be monitored. Hepatic: If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur (eosinophilia, rash), Diclofenac should be discontinued. All patients who are receiving long term treatment with NSAIDs should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).",

Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Diclofenac FC Tablet: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use. Diclofenac SR Tablet: \n\nAdult: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.\nChildren: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.\nElderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.\n\nDiclofenac Dispersible Tablet:\n\nAdults: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.\nChildren: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.\n\nDiclofenac TR Capsule: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.Diclofenac Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.Diclofenac injection: For adults the usual dose is 1 ampoule daily. In serious cases this dose may be increased up to 2 ampoules daily.Diclofenac Gel: For external use only. Depending on the size of area to be treated, 2-4 g of Diclofenac gel should be applied to the skin 3-4 times daily. To the affected area gel should be rubbed in lightly. This gel may also be given in addition to further treatment with other dosage forms of Diclofenac.",
    "Interaction": "A-Fenac SR may have the following drug interactions:Lithium and digoxin: A-Fenac SR may increase plasma concentrations of lithium and digoxin.Anticoagulants: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect.Antidiabetic agents: Clinical studies have shown that diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect.Cyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporin and diclofenac concomitantly.Methotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.Quinolone antimicrobials: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAID and quinolones.Other NSAIDs and steroids: Co-administration of diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With aspirin, the plasma levels of each is lowered, although no clinical significance is known.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated to the patients hypersensitive to any ingredient of the products. Peptic ulcer, hypersensitivity to Diclofenac like other non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents, Diclofenac is also contra-indicated in asthmatic patient in whom attack with asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by acetylsalicylic acid or by other drugs with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. This Gel should not be used under occlusive airtight dressings.",
    "Side Effects": "A-Fenac SR is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are mild, rare and transient. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may be sometimes complaining of epigastric pain, eructation, nausea and diarrhea or dizziness or headache. These effects are usually mild in nature. Peripheral edema and skin reactions, such as rash and eczema have also been encountered. A-Fenac SR Gel may cause local irritation and reddening of the skin and skin rash.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "During pregnancy, Diclofenac should be employed only for compelling reasons. The lowest effective dose should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. In view of insufficient clinical data, Diclofenac Sodium Gel is not recommended during pregnancy. A very insignificant quantity of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk but no undesirable effects on the infant to be expected.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "In rare instances where peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in patients under treatment with A-Fenac SR. In patients with advanced age should be kept under close observation. A-Fenac SR Gel should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes or mucus membranes, after application the hands should be washed properly and not to be taken by mouth.",

    "Pharmacology": "Beta-carotene, retinol, and retinal have effective and reliable vitamin A activity. Retinal and retinol are in chemical equilibrium in the body and have equivalent antixerophthalmic activity. Retinal combines with the rod pigment, opsin, in the retina to form rhodopsin, necessary for visual dark adaptation.Vitamin A prevents retardation of growth and preserves the epithe-lial cells' integrity. Normal adult liver storage is sufficient to satisfy two years'requirements of vitamin A. Vitamin A is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where the biosynthesis of vitamin A from beta-carotene takes place. Vitamin A absorption requires bile salts, pancreatic lipase, and dietary fat. It is transported in the blood to the liver by the chy lomicron fraction of the lymph. Vitamin Ais stored in Kupffer cells of the liver mainly as the palmitate. Normal serum vitamin A is 80-300 Units per 100 mL (plasma range is 30-70 mcg per dl) and for carotenoids 270-753 Units per 100 mL.The normal adult liver contains approximately 100 to 300 micrograms per gram, mostly as retinol palmitate.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Safety of amounts exceeding 6,000 Units of vitamin A daily during pregnancy has not been established at this time. The use of vitamin A in excess of the recommended dietary allowance may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have shown fetal abnormalities associated with over-dosage in several species. Malformations of the central nervous system, the eye, the palate, and the urogenital tract are recorded. Vitamin Ain excess of the recommended dietary allowance is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If vitamin Ais used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking vitamin A, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\u00a0The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A (5,000 Units) is recommended for nursing mothers.",

    "Composition": "Each box\u00a0contains 2 blister strips.\n\nOne strip contains 1 tablet of Mifepristone INN 200 mg.\nAnother strip contains 4 tablets of Misoprostol USP 200 microgram each.",
    "Pharmacology": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.Day 1 (First visit): Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.Day 2 (Second visit): Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit): Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",
    "Interaction": "Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of A-Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.",
    "Contraindications": "Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.",
    "Side Effects": "Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy- Mifepristone: is indicated for Menstrual Regulation (MR) (through 63 days pregnancy) and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.Lactation- \n\nMifepristone: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications.\nMisoprostol: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",

    "Pharmacology": "Pharmacodynamics: Miconazole possesses an antifungal activity against the common dermatophytes and yeasts as well as an antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive bacilli and cocci. Its activity is based on the inhibition of a demethylation step in the ergosterol biosynthesis. Ergosterol, the end-product of the biosynthetic pathway and the main sterol in yeast and fungi. The disruption in production of ergosterol disrupts the fungal cell membrane, causing holes to appear in it. These holes allow the essential constituents of the fungal cells to leak out and ultimately the fungal cells die.Pharmacokinetics: The oral bioavailability of Miconazole is low (25-30%) because there is little absorption of Miconazole from the intestinal tract. Miconazole is systemically absorbed after administration as the oral gel. Absorbed Miconazole is bound to plasma proteins (88.2%), primarily to serum albumin and red blood cells (10.6%). The absorbed portion of Miconazole oral gel is largely metabolized; less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The terminal plasma half-life is 20-25 hours in most patients. The elimination half-life of Miconazole is similar in any renal impaired patient.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant treatment with Terfenadine, Astemizole and Cisapride should be avoided because in vitro studies suggest that A-Migel may inhibit their metabolism, so these products miqht precipitated.\nA-Migel may delay Phenytoin and Cyclosporine metabolism and this might precipitate Phenytoin and Cyclosporine toxicity, respectively.",
    "Contraindications": "Miconazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient.",
    "Side Effects": "Occasionally nausea and vomiting, diarrhea with long term use and rarely allergic reactions.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There is no information regarding the safety of Miconazole oral gel during pregnancy. So Miconazole oral gel should be avoided in pregnant women if possible or the potential hazards should be balanced against the possible benefits. As many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Miconazole is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "If the concomitant use of A-Migel and anticoagulant is considered, the anti-coagulant effect should be monitored and titrated. A-Migel and phenytoin plasma level should also be monitored when used concomitantly. In infants and young children, caution must be taken to ensure that the gel does not obstruct the throat.",

    "Pharmacology": "Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.Absorption: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.Distribution: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.Excretion: 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and Children over 8 years: 250-500 mg every six hours for mild to moderate infections. This may be increased upto 4 gm. or more daily in severe cases.Elderly: No special dosage recommendation. Erythromycin may be administered if desired, three times daily or twice daily by giving one-third or half of the total daily requirement 8 hourly or 12 hourly respectively. Children aged 2 to 8 years: 250 mg. every six hours or 30-50 mg/kg body weight per day divided into four equal dosage. Infants and Children upto 2 years: 500 mg. in divided doses or 30-50 mg/kg body weight in divided doses.",
    "Interaction": "Recent data from studies of A-Mycin reveals that its use in patients who are receiving high dosage of theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In such cases this dose of theophylline should be reduced.",
    "Contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to Erythromycin.",
    "Side Effects": "Allergic reactions are rare and mild although anaphylaxis has occurred. Occasionally there is abdominal discomfort after oral administration, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. This discomfort usually subsides after a few days without it being necessary to reduce the dosage.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Clinical and Laboratory studies have been shown no evidence in human of teratogenicity or toxicity. However, caution should be exercised when prescribing this drug to pregnant patients and lactating mothers since erythromycin crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in breast milk.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

    "Pharmacology": "Atorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.Absorption: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Primary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia-\n\nAdults: Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily.\nChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily.\n\r\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia-\n\nAdults: Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia).\nChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily.\n\r\nPrevention of cardiovascular events-\n\nAdults: Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response.\n\nAnother guideline:\u00a0The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.",
    "Interaction": "The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals.Antacid: When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.Digoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.Warfarin: A-Statin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.",
    "Contraindications": "Atorvastatin should not be used in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. It is also contraindicated in patient with history of serious adverse reaction to prior administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",
    "Side Effects": "A-Statin is generally well-tolerated. The most frequent side effects related to A-Statin are constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain. Other side effects includes infection, headache, back pain, rash, asthenia, arthralgia, myalgia.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Atorvastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant women has not been established. No controlled clinical trials with atorvastatin have been conducted in pregnant women. Rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. Animal studies have shown toxicity to reproduction. Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnantLactation: It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rats, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its active metabolites are similar to those in milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed their infants. Atorvastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Liver effects: Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. A-Statin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or have a history of liver disease. A-Statin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.",

    "Composition": "Each box\u00a0contains 2 blister strips.\n\nOne strip contains 1 tablet of Mifepristone INN 200 mg.\nAnother strip contains 4 tablets of Misoprostol USP 200 microgram each.",
    "Pharmacology": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.Day 1 (First visit): Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.Day 2 (Second visit): Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit): Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",
    "Interaction": "Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of AB Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.",
    "Contraindications": "Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.",
    "Side Effects": "Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy- Mifepristone: is indicated for Menstrual Regulation (MR) (through 63 days pregnancy) and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.Lactation- \n\nMifepristone: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications.\nMisoprostol: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",

The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

These include-\n\nUndesirable Upper respiratory tract infections: sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngo-tracheo bronchitis and otitis media, and also\nLower respiratory tract infections: bronchitis (acute and chronic), lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia.\nUrinary tract infections: cystitis, urethritis and pyelonephritis.\nSkin and soft tissue infections: abscess, cellulitis, furunculosis and impetigo.\n\r\nThe following microorganisms are susceptible, in vitro to Abac: \n\nGram-positive: Staphylococci (both penicillin sensitive and resistant strains and penicillinase-producing species), Streptococci, Streptococci pyogenes (beta haemolytic), Streptococcus pneumonia.\nGram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenza, Shigella spp, Salmonella spp (including Salmonella typhi), Neisseria spp Many strains of E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus that produce the enzyme penicillinase and thus are ampicillin resistant, are susceptible to Abac which is unaffected by this enzyme.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cephradine is a semisynthetic broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic, it is active against infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Both penicillinase producing and nonproducing staphylococci are sensitive to Cephradine. The main site of action of Cephradine is the cell wall of bacteria. Cell wall of sensitive organism contains peptidoglycan. Cephradine inhibits cross-linking process and as a result cell wall with many pores are formed, thus lysis of bacteria occur due to external osmotic pressure.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "For oral administration-Adults:\n\nUrinary tract infections: 500mg four times daily or 1g twice daily. Infections which are severe or chronic may necessitate the administration of higher doses. Where complications arise including prostatitis and epididymitis continued intensive treatment is required.\nRespiratory tract infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, dependent on the site and severity of the infection.\nSkin and soft tissue infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, again dependent on the site and severity of the infection.\n\r\nChildren:\n\nTotal daily dose of 25 to 50mg/kg given in two or four equally divided doses.\nOtitis media: Total daily dose of 75 to 100mg/kg given in divided doses 6 to 12 hourly.\nMaximum daily dosage: 4 gm\n\r\nElderly: The normal adult dose is appropriate. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be monitored during treatment.For injectable administration- \n\nAdult: The usual dose is 2-4 gm daily in four equally divided doses up to 8 gm daily. For prophylaxis a single preoperative dose of 1-2 gm intramuscularly or intravenously is given.\nChildren: The dose is 50-100 mg/kg daily in four equally divided doses, up to 300 mg/kg daily in severe infection.",
    "Interaction": "The concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides with Cefradine may increase the risk of kidney damage. Diuretics (e.g. frusemide, ethacrynic acid) and probenecid enhanced the possibility of renal toxicity.",
    "Contraindications": "Cephradine should not be used in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.",
    "Side Effects": "Limited essentially to gastro-intestinal disturbances and on occasions to hypersensitivity phenomena. The latter are more likely to occur in individuals, who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity and thos with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever or urticaria. Skin reactions have occasionally been reported. Rare- Glossitis, heartburn, dizziness, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vaginitis, candida overgrowth. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria, skin rashes, joint pains, oedema.\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders- Unknown: blood disorders (including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and haemolytic anaemia)\nImmune system disorders- Unknown: Fever, serum sickness like reactions, anaphylaxis\nPsychiatric disorders- Unknown: Confusion, sleep disturbances\nNervous system disorders- Unknown: hyperactivity, hypertonia, dizziness, nervousness; Rarely: Headache\nHepatobiliary disorders- Frequency unknown: Liver, enzyme disturbances, transient hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice\nRenal and urinary disorders- Unknown: Reversible interstitial nephritis\nInvestigations- Unknown: Elevation of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Although animal studies have not demonstrated any teratogenicity, safety in pregnancy has not been established. Cephradine is excreted in breast milk and should be used with caution in lactating mothers. Since the medicine may cause dizziness, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Prolonged use of an anti-infective may result in the development of superinfection due to the emergence of resistant organisms.\nAbac should be administered with care to patients hypersensitive to penicillins because of the risk of cross-sensitivity between beta-lactam antibiotics.\nCephalosporin antibiotics may cause a positive result in Coombs\u2019 testing. When Coombs testing is performed on neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins prior to labour, it should be noted that a positive result may be due to the drug.\nAbac may cause a false positive urine glucose result when Benedict\u2019s or Fehling\u2019s solutions or tablets such as Clinitest are used in the testing. This does not occur with enzyme-based\u00a0tests (e.g. Clinistix, Diastix).\nDosage adjustment is necessary in renal impairment.\nAbac contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "First generation Cephalosporins",
    "Storage Conditions": "Abac Suspension should be freshly prepared. Reconstituted Suspension should be used within 7 days if kept at room temperature or within 14 days, if kept in a refrigerator. Abac Injection solutions should be used within 2 hours when kept at room temperature. When stored at 5\u00b0C, solutions retain potency for 12 hours. Reconstituted solutions may vary in colour from light to straw yellow; however, this does not affect the potency. Do not use later than the date of expiry.

In patients undergoing haemodialysis, a predialysis loading dose of 250 mg-1 g is recommended. A maintaining dose of 250-500 mg every 6 hourly during interdialytic period may be used.Geriatric use: Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.",
    "Interaction": "Abaclor may show a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine with tests that use Benedict's solution, Fehling's solutions. When Abaclor and oral anticoagulants were administered concomitantly there have been reports of increased anticoagulant effect and there have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, in patients receiving Abaclor and anticoagulants (Warfarin) concomitantly. It is recommended that in such patients, regular monitoring of prothrombin time should be considered, with adjustment of dosage if necessary.",
    "Contraindications": "Cefaclor is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the Cephalosporin group of antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "Gastro-intestinal symptoms may occur include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting in some patients receiving Abaclor. As with some penicillins and some other Cephalosporins, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely. Fever, abdominal pain, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hemorrhage, elevated LDH and pancytopenia may occur.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Small amounts of Cefaclor have been detected in mother's milk. The effect on nursing infants is not known. Caution should be exercised when Cefaclor is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Prescribing Abaclor in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.Prolonged use of Abaclor may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. As with other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, the renal excretion of Abaclor is inhibited by Probenecid. Antibiotics, including Cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.Before therapy with Abaclor is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to Abaclor, Cephalosporins, Penicillins or other drugs. If Abaclor is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised. Abaclor should be administered cautiously to any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Second generation Cephalosporins",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store at room temperature and protect from light. After reconstitution the suspension can be used within 7 days if kept at room temperature and within 14 days if kept in refrigerator (2-8\u00b0C). Always keep the bottle tightly closed."

    "generic_id": "32905",
    "Indications": "Abacten is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Abacten is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
    "Pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:\n\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nOther microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila\nAnaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",
    "Interaction": "Antacid: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should\u00a0be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic\u00a0interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of\u00a0carbamazepine or its active metabolite. Cyclosporin: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics\u00a0interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from\u00a0pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin\u00a0and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations\u00a0is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted\u00a0accordingly. Digoxin: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the\u00a0metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant\u00a0azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and\u00a0digoxin levels monitored. Ergot derivatives: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism,\u00a0azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. Methylprednisolone: In a\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on\u00a0the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. Theophylline: There is no evidence of any\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy\u00a0volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. Warfarin: In a\u00a0pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a\u00a0single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Abacten and warfarin may\u00a0be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely\u00a0performed. Terfenadine: Abacten did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine\u00a0administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did\u00a0not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the\u00a0steady state dosing of terfenadine.",
    "Contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
    "Side Effects": "Abacten is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.",

    "Pharmacology": "Insulin Glargine is a sterile solution of insulin glargine for use as a subcutaneous injection. Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is a long-acting (up to 24-hour duration of action), parenteral blood glucose lowering agent. Insulin Glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology. Primary function of insulin glargine is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose by stimulation peripheral glucose uptake, primarily by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.",
    "Interaction": "A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment. The following substances may reduce the Abasaglar as well as Abasaglar requirements: Oral anti-diabetic products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.The following substances may increase the Abasaglar as well as Abasaglar requirements: Thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, beta-sympathomimetics, growth hormone and danazol. Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin.",

Read moreAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:\u03b2 carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with \u03b2 carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
    "Pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this\u00a0tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of \u03b2 carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
    "Contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
    "Side Effects": "\u03b2 carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "\u03b2 carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "There are some evidences that \u03b2 carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Anti-oxidant Multivitamin preparations",
    "Storage Conditions": "Should be stored in a dry place below 30\u02daC."

    "Pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Substitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.Initial therapy: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily. Due to decreased clearance of Amlodipine among elderly patients the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine is 2.5 mg in patients 75 years. The lowest dose of the combination is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with this combination drug is not recommended in patients >75 years old.",
    "Interaction": "The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesartan Medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes should be closely monitored in patients on combination therapy and other agents that affect the RAS.",
    "Contraindications": "Cannot be co-administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects include peripheral edema, headache, flushing, and dizziness. It can also cause Intestinal problems known a sprue-like enteropathy.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should not be used in 2nd and 3rd trimester because it can cause fetal death. When pregnancy is detected this combination should be discontinued as soon as possible. It is not known whether Olmesartan and Amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should be used with caution because there is a risk for-\n\nHypotension in volume- or salt depleted patients.\nVasodilation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\nIncreased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute Ml in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.",

    "Pharmacology": "Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Abemaciclib tablets are taken orally with or without food.\n\nRecommended starting dose in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor: 150 mg twice daily.\nRecommended starting dose as monotherapy: 200 mg twice daily.\nDosing interruption and/or dose reductions may be required based on individual safety and tolerability.",

    "Pharmacology": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults & children over 2 years: \n\n400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) as a single dose in cases of Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus.\nIn cases of strongyloidiasis or taeniasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) daily should be given for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured on follow-up after three weeks, a second course of treatment is indicated.\u00a0\n\nChildren of 1-2 years: Recommended dose is a single dose of 200 mg (5 ml suspension).Children under 1 year: Not recommended.In Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis): \n\nAlbendazole is given by mouth with meals in a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 28 days for patients weighing over 60 kg.\nA dose of 15 mg/kg body weight daily in two divided doses (to a maximum total daily dose of 800 mg) is used for patients weighing less than 60 kg.\nFor cystic echinococcosis, the 28 days course may be repeated after 14 days without treatment, to a total of 3 treatment cycles.\nFor alveolar echinococcosis, cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 14 days without treatment, may need to continue for months or years.\nIn giardiasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) once daily for five days is used.",
    "Interaction": "No interaction involving Aben-DS, either pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic, has been reported.",
    "Contraindications": "Neonates: Albendazole is not normally used in neonates.Children: Reduction of the dose from 400 mg to 200 mg may be indicated in children weighing less than 10 kg but there are no grounds for a general reduction in dosage to children.Pregnant woman: Albendazole should not be given during pregnancy or women thought to be pregnant. No information is available on placental transfer.Concurrent disease: There is no evidence to suggest that dose should be altered in renal, hepatic or cardiac failure.",
    "Side Effects": "Gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness, changes in liver enzymes, rarely reversible alopecia; rash, fever, blood disorders including leucopenia and pancytopenia reported; allergic shock if cyst leakage; convulsion and meningism in cerebral disease.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "US FDA Pregnancy category of Albendazole is C. So, Albendazole should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation unless the potential benefits to the other outweigh the possible risks to the fetus.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Blood counts and liver function tests before treatment and twice during each cycle; breastfeeding; exclude pregnancy before starting treatment.

    "Indications": "Abetis tablet is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.",
    "Pharmacology": "Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Dosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily. No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Abetis was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Abetis is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Abetis and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.",
    "Contraindications": "Olmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.",
    "Side Effects": "Abetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Abetis (0.9%) patients.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "When pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Abetis. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death.

    "strength": "40 mg",
    "manufacturer": "ACI Limited",
    "unit_price": "\u09f3 18.00",
    "pack_size_info": "(5 x 10: \u09f3 900.00)",
    "generic_id": "2778",
    "Indications": "Abetis tablet is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.",
    "Pharmacology": "Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Dosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily. No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Abetis was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Abetis is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Abetis and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.",
    "Contraindications": "Olmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.",
    "Side Effects": "Abetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Abetis (0.9%) patients.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "When pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Abetis. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Angiotensin-ll receptor blocker",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

    "Indications": "This\u00a0is indicated for the symptomatic relief of upper respiratory tract disorders accompanied by productive cough which benefits from the administration of a nasal decongestant, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist and an expectorant combination.",
    "Pharmacology": "Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant as well as a bronchodilator for the upper respiratory tract, which gives symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. Pseudoephedrine is both an \u03b1-and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It causes vasoconstriction via direct stimulation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors of the respiratory mucosa. It also directly stimulates \u03b2-adrenergic receptors causing bronchial relaxation, increased heart rate and contractility.Like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites, an indirect effect. This is its main and direct mechanism of action. The displaced noradrenaline is released into the neuronal synapse where it is free to activate the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors.Guaifenesin reduces the viscosity of tenacious sputum and is used as an expectorant. It increases the hydration of respiratory tract, thereby increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of bronchial secretions.Triprolidine is an antihistamine; it is used for the symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reactions including rhinitis, conjunctivitis and urticaria.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and Children over 12 years: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) three times a day.Children 6-12 years: 5 ml (1 teaspoonful) three times a day.Children 2-5 years: 2.5 ml (1/2 teaspoonful) three times a day.A physician\u2019s advice is preferred before administering this preparation to children aged less than 2 years.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant use of Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine with sympathomimetic agents such as decongestants, tricyclic antidepressants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants or with monoamine oxidase inhibitors which interfere with the catabolism of sympathomimetic amines may occasionally cause a rise in blood pressure. Because of its pseudoephedrine content, Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine partially reverse the hypotensive action of drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity including guanethidine, methyldopa, alpha-adrenergic blocking agents.",
    "Contraindications": "This is contraindicated in the cases of known hypersensitivity to any of its constituents, cardiovascular disease including hypertension, lower respiratory symptoms including asthma, monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy.",
    "Side Effects": "CNS depression or excitation, drowsiness (reported most frequently), sleep disturbances, hallucinations (rarely reported), skin rashes with or without irritation, tachycardia, dryness of mouth, nose and throat have occasionally been reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Although pseudoephedrine, triprolidine and guaiphenesin have been in widespread use of many years without apparent ill consequence, there are no specific data on their use during pregnancy. Caution should therefore be exercised by balancing the potential benefits of treatment of the mother against any possible hazards to the developing fetus.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As with any other antihistamine therapy, Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine may cause drowsiness. If affected, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery. Concomitant administration of alcohol or other centrally acting sedatives should be avoided. Although Pseudoephedrine has no pressor effects in normotensive patients but Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine should be used with caution to patients suffering from mild to moderate hypertension. Moreover, caution should also be exercised in the following disease conditions - hypertension and heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, elevated intra-ocular pressure, prostatic enlargement, severe renal and hepatic impairment. Abex should not be used for persistent or chronic cough, which occurs with smoking, asthma or emphysema or where excessive secretions accompany cough, unless directed by a physician.",

    "Pharmacology": "Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Abemaciclib tablets are taken orally with or without food.\n\nRecommended starting dose in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor: 150 mg twice daily.\nRecommended starting dose as monotherapy: 200 mg twice daily.\nDosing interruption and/or dose reductions may be required based on individual safety and tolerability.",
    "Interaction": "CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Reduce the Abezino dose with concomitant use of other strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers.",
    "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) were diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, Abemaciclib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose.

    "Indications": "Abiraxen is a CYP17 inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with\n\nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).\nMetastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).",
    "Pharmacology": "Abiraterone Acetate is converted in vivo to Abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 \u03b1-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions:1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 \u03b1-hydroxy derivatives by 17 \u03b1-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended Dose For Metastatic CRPC: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Recommended Dose For Metastatic High-Risk CSPC: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg administered orally once daily. Patients receiving Abiraterone Acetate should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone Acetate must be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or at least two hours atier a meal. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water.

    "Interaction": "Drugs That Inhibit Or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes: Based on in vitro data, Abiraxen is a substrate of CYP3A4. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of Abiraxen by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during Abiraxen treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraxen dosing frequency. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of Abiraxen.Effects Of Abiraxen On Drug Metabolizing Enzymes: Abiraxen is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of Dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when Dextromethorphan was given with Abiraxen 1,000 mg daily and Prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of Abiraxen with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., Thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of Pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when Pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg Abiraxen. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with Abiraxen.",

    "Pharmacology": "Abiraterone Acetate is converted in vivo to Abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 \u03b1-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions:1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 \u03b1-hydroxy derivatives by 17 \u03b1-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial.

    "Indications": "Abixa is indicated for the treatment of all froms of dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Abixa may also be indicated in other types of dementia.",
    "Pharmacology": "Persistent activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in Central Nervous System by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels.Memantine is well absorbed after oral administration and has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. Following oral administration, Memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrtions reached in about 3-7 hours. Food has no effect on the absorption of Memantine. The mean volume of distribution of Memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). emantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy Memantine and 1-nitroso-deaminated Memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. The hepatic microsomal CYP-450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of Memantine.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended maintenance dose of Memantine\u00a0for adults and older patients is 20 mg every day. In order to lower the risk of side effects, the dose should be achieved by upward titration with 5 mg per week over 3 weeks, achieving the maintenance dose of 20 mg/day from the start of week 4 according to the following dosage guideline:Week 1 (Everyday):\u00a0Morning- 5 mg (1 tablet),\u00a0Night- No doseWeek 2 (Everyday):\u00a0Morning- 5 mg (1 tablet),\u00a0Night- 5 mg (1 tablet)Week 3 (Everyday):\u00a0Morning- 10 mg (2 tablets),\u00a0Night- 5 mg (1 tablet)Week 4 and onwards (Everyday):\u00a0Morning- 10 mg (2 tablets),\u00a0Night- 10 mg (2 tablets)Missed Dose: If any dose is missed, just wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double the dose to compensate for the missed dose.In case renal impairment: In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two downward strokes). If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5-29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two downward strokes) per day.In case of hepatic impairment: In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function, no dosage adjustment is needed. Administration of memantine is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Children under 18 years: Memantine is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.",
    "Interaction": "Due to the pharmacological effects and mechanism of action of memantine suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and anticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as memantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant administration of mematine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify their effects and a dosage adjustment may be necessary. Abixa should not be used with amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan, phenytoin, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinidine, quinine & nicotine.",
    "Contraindications": "Memantine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Memantine Hydrochloride or to any excipients used in the formulation.",
    "Side Effects": "Most frequent side effects (frequency of 2% or less) include hallucination, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. Occasional side effects include anxiety, hypertonus (heightened muscle tension), vomiting, bladder infections and increased sexual drive. If there is a history of epileptic seizures, there is a slight chance that Abixa may increase the probability of an attack.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. Yet there are no adequate and well controlled studies of Memantine in pregnant women. Memantine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Memantine is excreted in human breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Memantine is administered to a nursing mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Caregivers should be instructed in the recommended administration (twice per day for doses above 5 mg) and dose escalation (minimum interval of one week between dose increases). If the patients suffer from kidney dysfunction, the kidney function should be monitored at regular basis.Seizures: Abixa has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. One clinical trial shows that seizures occurred in 0.2% of patients treated with Abixa and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: Study shows that no risk of carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility are caused after Abixa use.Operating Vehicles or Machinery: Taking Abixa may alter the reaction time significantly; therefore safe driving and safe operation of machinery may no longer be possible.",

    "Composition": "Each box\u00a0contains 2 blister strips.\n\nOne strip contains 1 tablet of Mifepristone INN 200 mg.\nAnother strip contains 4 tablets of Misoprostol USP 200 microgram each.",
    "Pharmacology": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.Day 1 (First visit): Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.Day 2 (Second visit): Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit): Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",
    "Interaction": "Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of ABO Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.",
    "Contraindications": "Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.",
    "Side Effects": "Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy- Mifepristone: is indicated for Menstrual Regulation (MR) (through 63 days pregnancy) and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.Lactation- \n\nMifepristone: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications.\nMisoprostol: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",

    "pack_size_info": "(3 x 10: \u09f3 435.00)",
    "generic_id": "35355",
    "Indications": "Aboprost is indicated for-\n\nProphylaxis of gastric and duodenal ulceration in NSAID users at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer e.g. the elderly, patients with concomitant debilitating disease and patients with a history of ulcer.\nHealing of established NSAID- induced gastric and duodenal damage.\nHealing of gastric and duodenal ulcers in the absence of NSAID therapy.\nInduction of labor.\nPrevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.",
    "Pharmacology": "Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. Maximum plasma concentrations of Misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of Misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 meg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of Misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Benign gastric and duodenal ulceration and NSAID associated ulceration: 800 mcg daily (in 2-4 divided doses) with breakfast or main meals and at bedtime; treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks and may be continued for up to 8 weeks if required.Prophylaxis of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcer: 200 mcg 2-4 times daily taken with NSAID. If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician.Induction of labor: Place 25 mcg in the posterior fornix of the vagina. Repeat after every 6 hours if necessary until the maximum dosage of 200 mcg total misoprostol is reached. Fetal heart rate and uterus contractions should be monitored. Alternatively, 100 mcg taken orally. If cervical ripening or active labor does not occur, repeated dose of 100-200 mcg of oral misoprostol is given every 4 hourly until labor is established (as evidenced by a Bishop score of 7 or more). Maximum number of dose is 6. Maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate and contractions should be monitored. Oxytocin can be started 4 hours after last dose of misoprostol. Physician should be notified for signs of fetal distress or tetanic uterine contractions. Oral misoprostol therapy should be monitored by Physician.Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage: 600 mcg orally immediately following delivery.Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage: 600 mcg orally or 1000 mcg per rectally.",
    "Interaction": "There is no evidence of clinically significant interaction between Aboprost and cardiac, pulmonary, CNS drugs and NSAID's. The bioavailability\u00a0of Aboprost is decreased with high doses of antacid.",
    "Contraindications": "Misoprostol is contraindicated to anyone with a history of allergy to prostaglandins and it is also contraindicated in pregnancy.",
    "Side Effects": "Generally, Aboprost is well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects associated with Aboprost therapy involve the GI tract such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rashes and dizziness. The incidence of diarrhea may be minimized by administering the drug after meal and at bedtime and by avoiding concomitant administration with a magnesium-containing or other laxative antacid.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Because of the abortifacient property of the Misoprostol component, it is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. It should not be used in women of childbearing potential unless the patient requires nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and is at high risk of developing gastric or duodenal ulceration or for developing complications from gastric or duodenal ulcers associated with the use of the NSAID. In such patients, it may be prescribed if the patient:\n\nhas had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy.\nis capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures.\nhas received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of Misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake.\nwill begin it only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period.\n\r\nExcretion of the active metabolite (Misoprostol acid) into milk is possible but has not been studied. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is not recommended for use by nursing mothers.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "In case of prevention and treatment of NSAID induced gastric and duodenal ulcer: Aboprost is contraindicated in women who are pregnant, and should not be used in women of child bearing potential unless the patient requires NSAID therapy. Women of child bearing potential should be told that they must not be pregnant when Aboprost therapy is initiated and they must use an effective contraception method while taking Aboprost.In case of induction of labor: The pregnancy should have completed 38 weeks gestation by reliable dating, or lung maturity as evidenced by a L/S >2.0 or a positive phosphotidyl glycerol test, or completed 36 weeks gestation with a maternal or fetal medical indication for induction of labor. Induction of labor is contraindicated in acute fetal distress, abruptio placenta, placenta previa or unexplained vaginal bleeding. The fetus should be in vertex presentation.",

    "Indications": "This eye drop is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.",
    "Pharmacology": "This eye drops is comprised of two components: Brimonidine Tartrate & Timolol Maleate. Brimonidine Tartrate is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist having a dual mechanism of action. It decreases aqueous humor production and increases nonpressure dependent uveoscleral outflow. Timolol Maleate is a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. It lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humor production. Therefore the combination of both drugs gives a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen within two hours of administration.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Instill 1 drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily.",
    "Interaction": "Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Also contraindicated in bronchial asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinus bradycardia, second or third-degree atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects are allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival folliculosis, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye pruritus and ocular burning or stinging.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Combipres should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Timolol has been detected in human milk but it is not known whether Brimonidine Tartrate is excreted in human milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Like other topically applied ophthalmic agents, it may be absorbed systemically. Due to the presence of Timolol, the same types of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse reactions as seen with systemic beta-blockers may occur. Cautions should be exercised in treating patients with severe or unstable and uncontrolled cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Drugs for miotics and glaucoma",

    "Pharmacology": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

    "Pharmacology": "Acalabrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. In nonclinical studies, acalabrutinib inhibited BTK-mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69 and inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenograft models.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of Acalabrutinib is 100 mg taken orally approximately every twelve hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Advise patients to swallow capsule whole with water. Advise patients not to open, break or chew the capsules. Acalabrutinib may be taken with or without food. If a dose of Acalabrutinib is missed by more than 3 hours, it should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at its regularly scheduled time. Extra capsules of Acalabrutinib should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.Recommended Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions: Dosage of Acalabrutinib can be reduced up to 100 mg daily for the toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level. If the adverse reaction occurrence more than four times Acalabrutinib can be Discontinue.",
    "Interaction": "Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Acaluxen: Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (200 mg Iitraconazole once daily for 5 days) increased the Acaluxen Cmax by 3.9-fold and AUC by 5.1-fold in healthy subjects. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations with Acaluxen and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem) showed that co-administration increased Acaluxen Cmax and AUC increased by 2- to almost 3-fold.Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Acaluxen: Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer (600 mg rifampin once daily for 9 days) decreased Acaluxen Cmax by 68% and AUC by 77% in healthy subjects.Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: Acaluxen solubility decreases with increasing pH. Co-administration with an antacid (1 g calcium carbonate) decreased Acaluxen AUC by 53% in healthy subjects. Co-administration with a proton pump inhibitor (40 mg omeprazole for 5 days) decreased Acaluxen AUC by 43%.In Vitro Studies-Metabolic Pathways: Acaluxen is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, but does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. The active metabolite (ACP-5862) is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, but does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5. Acaluxen is a weak inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4; the active metabolite (ACP-5862) weakly induces CYP3A4. Based on in vitro data and PBPK modeling, no interaction with CYP substrates is expected at clinically relevant concentrations.Drug Transporter Systems: Acaluxen is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. Acaluxen is not a substrate of renal uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2, or hepatic transporters OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Acaluxen does not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. Acaluxen may increase exposure to co-administered BCRP substrates (e.g., methotrexate) by inhibition of intestinal BCRP.",
    "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226530%) were: anemia, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, headache, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Based on findings in animals, Acalabrutinib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of Acalabrutinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in reduced fetal growth at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times exposures in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Lactation: No data are available regarding the presence of Acalabrutinib or its active metabolite in human milk, its effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats. Due to the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from Acalabrutinib, advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking Acalabrutinib and for at least 2 weeks after the final dose.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hemorrhage: Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have occurred in the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acaluxen monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events, including gastrointestinal, intracranial, and epistaxis have been reported in 2% of patients. Overall, bleeding events including bruising and petechiae of any grade occurred in approximately 50% of patients with hematological malignancies. The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. Acaluxen may further increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies and patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding Acaluxen for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.Infection: Serious infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), including fatal events and opportunistic infections have occurred in the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acaluxen monotherapy. Consider prophylaxis in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 18% of these patients. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 infection was pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and progressive multifocaln leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate. Cytopenias: In the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies, patients treated with Acaluxen monotherapy experienced Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (23%), anemia (11%) and thrombocytopenia (8%) based on laboratory measurements. In the Acaluxen clinical Trial LY-004, patients\u2019 complete blood counts were assessed monthly during treatment.Second Primary Malignancies: Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinomas, have occurred in 11% of patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acaluxen monotherapy in the combined safety database of 612 patients. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer, reported in 7% of patients. Advise protection from sun exposure.Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter: In the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Acaluxen monotherapy, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of any grade occurred in 3% of patients, and Grade 3 in 1% of patients. Monitor for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.",

    "Indications": "Acaril is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2\u00a0diabetes mellitus.",
    "Pharmacology": "In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose\u00a0does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose\u00a0to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose\u00a0diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dosage of Acarbose\u00a0is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d. Maintenance Dosage Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of Acarbose\u00a0should be adjusted at 4\u20138 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.",
    "Interaction": "Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Acaril, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving Acaril\u00a0in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia.Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Acaril\u00a0given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made. Very rarely, individual cases of hypoglycemic shock have been reported in patients receiving Acaril\u00a0therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.",
    "Contraindications": "Acarbose\u00a0is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis. Acarbose\u00a0is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction. In addition, Acarbose\u00a0is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.",
    "Side Effects": "Diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, constipation, or stomach pain may occur in the first few weeks of treatment as your body adjusts to this medication but usually improve with time. Follow your prescribed diet to help lessen these side effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. The safety of Acarbose\u00a0in pregnant women has not been established. A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Acarbose\u00a0should not be administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Because of its mechanism of action, Acaril when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Because Acaril given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when Acaril was added to metformin therapy.Oral glucose (dextrose), whose\u00a0absorption\u00a0is not inhibited by Acaril, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and\u00a0fructose\u00a0is inhibited by Acaril, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either\u00a0intravenous\u00a0glucose infusion or glucagon injection.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Alpha-Glucosidase inhibitor",

    "pack_size_info": "(2 x 3: \u09f3 330.00)",
    "generic_id": "32289",
    "Indications": "Accuzith is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Accuzith is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
    "Pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:\n\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nOther microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila\nAnaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",
    "Interaction": "Antacid: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should\u00a0be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic\u00a0interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of\u00a0carbamazepine or its active metabolite. Cyclosporin: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics\u00a0interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from\u00a0pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin\u00a0and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations\u00a0is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted\u00a0accordingly. Digoxin: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the\u00a0metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant\u00a0azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and\u00a0digoxin levels monitored. Ergot derivatives: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism,\u00a0azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. Methylprednisolone: In a\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on\u00a0the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. Theophylline: There is no evidence of any\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy\u00a0volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. Warfarin: In a\u00a0pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a\u00a0single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Accuzith and warfarin may\u00a0be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely\u00a0performed. Terfenadine: Accuzith did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine\u00a0administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did\u00a0not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the\u00a0steady state dosing of terfenadine.",
    "Contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
    "Side Effects": "Accuzith is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.",
    "Common Questions": "What is Accuzith 500 mg Tablet?Accuzith 500 mg Tablet performs its action by preventing the synthesis of essential proteins required by bacteria to carry out vital functions.What are the uses of Accuzith 500 mg Tablet?Accuzith 500 mg Tablet is used for the treatment and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and skin and soft tissue infections.What are the Side Effects of Accuzith 500 mg Tablet?Side effects include diarrhea, dry or scaly skin, abdominal pain, difficult or painful urination, vomiting, fever, acid or sour stomach, aggression or anger, excessive air or gas in the stomach, and heartburn.What are the instructions for storage and disposal Accuzith 500 mg Tablet?Accuzith 500 mg Tablet should be kept in a cool dry place and its original packaging.

    "Contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
    "Side Effects": "Accuzith is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",

    "Indications": "Ace is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

    "Indications": "Ace is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works.

Caffeine is an alkaloid which is a theophylline-like xanthine derivative. By intermolecular association with Paracetamol, Caffeine increases the solubility and transmembrane permeation of Paracetamol. In addition, Caffeine increases the pain threshold and tolerance of pain. Caffeine has also an intrinsic power to raise vessel tone in the brain, which provides another benefit to treat migraine and headache.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult dose: 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours. Maximum dose: 8 tablets daily. Child dose: Not recommended for children below 12 years.",
    "Interaction": "May reduce serum levels with anticonvulsants (e.g. phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine). May enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarins with prolonged use. Accelerated absorption with metoclopramide and domperidone. May increase serum levels with probenecid. May increase serum levels of chloramphenicol. May reduce absorption with colestyramine within 1 hr of admin. May cause severe hypothermia with phenothiazine.",
    "Contraindications": "Paracetamol is contraindicated in patients with severe renal function impairment and hepatic disease (Viral Hepatitis). Known hypersensitivity to paracetamol or caffeine.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

    "Pharmacology": "Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Acecard and cause deterioration of renal function.",
    "Contraindications": "Ramipril must not be used\n\nin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\nin patients with a history of angioedema.\nconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\nin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\nin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\nwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\nwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nduring pregnancy.\n\r\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.",
    "Side Effects": "Acecard is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Ramipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Acecard should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician."

    "Pharmacology": "Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Acecard and cause deterioration of renal function.",
    "Contraindications": "Ramipril must not be used\n\nin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\nin patients with a history of angioedema.\nconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\nin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\nin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\nwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\nwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nduring pregnancy.\n\r\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.",
    "Side Effects": "Acecard is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects.

The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces.",

Read moreAcefra is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by sensitive Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These include-\n\nUndesirable Upper respiratory tract infections: sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngo-tracheo bronchitis and otitis media, and also\nLower respiratory tract infections: bronchitis (acute and chronic), lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia.\nUrinary tract infections: cystitis, urethritis and pyelonephritis.\nSkin and soft tissue infections: abscess, cellulitis, furunculosis and impetigo.\n\r\nThe following microorganisms are susceptible, in vitro to Acefra: \n\nGram-positive: Staphylococci (both penicillin sensitive and resistant strains and penicillinase-producing species), Streptococci, Streptococci pyogenes (beta haemolytic), Streptococcus pneumonia.\nGram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenza, Shigella spp, Salmonella spp (including Salmonella typhi), Neisseria spp Many strains of E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus that produce the enzyme penicillinase and thus are ampicillin resistant, are susceptible to Acefra which is unaffected by this enzyme.",
    "Pharmacology": "Cephradine is a semisynthetic broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic, it is active against infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Both penicillinase producing and nonproducing staphylococci are sensitive to Cephradine. The main site of action of Cephradine is the cell wall of bacteria. Cell wall of sensitive organism contains peptidoglycan. Cephradine inhibits cross-linking process and as a result cell wall with many pores are formed, thus lysis of bacteria occur due to external osmotic pressure.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "For oral administration-Adults:\n\nUrinary tract infections: 500mg four times daily or 1g twice daily. Infections which are severe or chronic may necessitate the administration of higher doses. Where complications arise including prostatitis and epididymitis continued intensive treatment is required.\nRespiratory tract infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, dependent on the site and severity of the infection.\nSkin and soft tissue infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, again dependent on the site and severity of the infection.\n\r\nChildren:\n\nTotal daily dose of 25 to 50mg/kg given in two or four equally divided doses.\nOtitis media: Total daily dose of 75 to 100mg/kg given in divided doses 6 to 12 hourly.\nMaximum daily dosage: 4 gm\n\r\nElderly: The normal adult dose is appropriate. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be monitored during treatment.For injectable administration- \n\nAdult: The usual dose is 2-4 gm daily in four equally divided doses up to 8 gm daily. For prophylaxis a single preoperative dose of 1-2 gm intramuscularly or intravenously is given.\nChildren: The dose is 50-100 mg/kg daily in four equally divided doses, up to 300 mg/kg daily in severe infection.",
    "Interaction": "The concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides with Cefradine may increase the risk of kidney damage. Diuretics (e.g. frusemide, ethacrynic acid) and probenecid enhanced the possibility of renal toxicity.",
    "Contraindications": "Cephradine should not be used in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.",
    "Side Effects": "Limited essentially to gastro-intestinal disturbances and on occasions to hypersensitivity phenomena. The latter are more likely to occur in individuals, who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity and thos with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever or urticaria. Skin reactions have occasionally been reported. Rare- Glossitis, heartburn, dizziness, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vaginitis, candida overgrowth. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria, skin rashes, joint pains, oedema.\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders- Unknown: blood disorders (including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and haemolytic anaemia)\nImmune system disorders- Unknown: Fever, serum sickness like reactions, anaphylaxis\nPsychiatric disorders- Unknown: Confusion, sleep disturbances\nNervous system disorders- Unknown: hyperactivity, hypertonia, dizziness, nervousness; Rarely: Headache\nHepatobiliary disorders- Frequency unknown: Liver, enzyme disturbances, transient hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice\nRenal and urinary disorders- Unknown: Reversible interstitial nephritis\nInvestigations- Unknown: Elevation of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Although animal studies have not demonstrated any teratogenicity, safety in pregnancy has not been established. Cephradine is excreted in breast milk and should be used with caution in lactating mothers. Since the medicine may cause dizziness, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Prolonged use of an anti-infective may result in the development of superinfection due to the emergence of resistant organisms.\nAcefra should be administered with care to patients hypersensitive to penicillins because of the risk of cross-sensitivity between beta-lactam antibiotics.\nCephalosporin antibiotics may cause a positive result in Coombs\u2019 testing. When Coombs testing is performed on neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins prior to labour, it should be noted that a positive result may be due to the drug.\nAcefra may cause a false positive urine glucose result when Benedict\u2019s or Fehling\u2019s solutions or tablets such as Clinitest are used in the testing. This does not occur with enzyme-based\u00a0tests (e.g. Clinistix, Diastix).\nDosage adjustment is necessary in renal impairment.\nAcefra contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "First generation Cephalosporins",
    "Storage Conditions": "Acefra Suspension should be freshly prepared. Reconstituted Suspension should be used within 7 days if kept at room temperature or within 14 days, if kept in a refrigerator. Acefra Injection solutions should be used within 2 hours when kept at room temperature. When stored at 5\u00b0C, solutions retain potency for 12 hours. Reconstituted solutions may vary in colour from light to straw yellow; however, this does not affect the potency. Do not use later than the date of expiry.

    "Indications": "Acemox is indicated in open angle glaucoma, secondary glaucoma and as an adjuvant in the treatment of edema and epilepsy.",
    "Pharmacology": "Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon-di-oxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In the eye, this inhibitory action of Acetazolamide decreases the secretion of aqueous humor and results in a drop in intraocular pressure, a reaction considered desirable in case of glaucoma. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the central nervous system appears to retard abnormal paroxysmal and excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons. So, Acetazolamide is also used as an adjuvant in the treatment of epilepsy.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults : Initially 250 mg (1 tablet) 4 times daily. Dose should be adjusted later with individual need. Children : \u00bd to 2 tablets in divided doses. In intraocular pressure: 1 tablet 6 hourly. In acute condition, dose should be started with 2 tablets followed by 1 tablet 6 hourly or as directed by the physician",
    "Contraindications": "Acetazolamide is contraindicated in cases of marked kidney and liver diseases or dysfunction, in situations in which sodium and or potassium blood serum levels decreased. Acetazolamide is also contraindicated in patients with chronic noncongestive angle closure glaucoma",
    "Side Effects": "Common side effects are headache, drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, anorexia, polyurea, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

    "Indications": "Acep is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Read moreAceril tablet indicated in the following cases:\n\nHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\nCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\nTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\nTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\nReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).",
    "Pharmacology": "Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Aceril and cause deterioration of renal function.",
    "Contraindications": "Ramipril must not be used\n\nin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\nin patients with a history of angioedema.\nconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\nin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\nin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\nwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\nwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nduring pregnancy.\n\r\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.",
    "Side Effects": "Aceril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Ramipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Aceril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician."

    "Pharmacology": "Acyclovir exerts its antiviral e\u00adects on Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with Herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Acyclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Acyclovir Triphosphate. Acyclovir is converted to Acyclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase, the monophosphate is phosphorylated to diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via other cellular enzymes to the Triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug.",
    "Interaction": "Co-administration of probenecid with Acerux has been shown to increase the mean Acerux half-life and the area under the concentration time curve. Urinary excretion and renal clearance correspondingly reduced. In patients over 60 years of age concurrent use of diuretics increases plasma levels of Acerux very significantly.",
    "Contraindications": "Acyclovir IV Injection is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to Acyclovir or Valacyclovir.",
    "Side Effects": "Some infrequent adverse reactions are lethargy, obtundation, tremors, confusion, hallucinations, agitation, somnolence, psychosis, convulsions and coma, phlebitis, nausea, vomiting, reversible increases in liver-related enzymes, pruritus, urticaria, rashes, increases in blood urea and creatinine.

There is no experience of the effect of Acyclovir on human fertility.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Acerux IV injection is intended for intravenous infusion only and should not be used through any other route. Reconstituted Acerux IV Infusion has a pH of approximately 11.0 and should not be administered by mouth. Acerux IV injection as infusion must be given over a period of at least one hour in order to avoid renal tubular damage. It should not be administered as a bolus injection. Acerux IV infusion must be accompanied by adequate hydration. Since maximum urine concentration occurs within the first few hours following infusion, particular attention should be given to establish sufficient urine \u2011ow during that period. Concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, pre-existing renal disease and dehydration increase the risk of further renal impairment by Acerux. As Acerux has been associated with reversible encephalopathic changes, it should be used with caution in patients with neurological abnormalities, significant hypoxia or serious renal, hepatic or electrolyte abnormalities.",

    "Pharmacology": "Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) in cell culture and in vivo. The inhibitory activity of Acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts Acyclovir into Acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, Acyclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: \n\nCompetitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase\nIncorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain\nInactivation of the viral DNA polymerase\n\r\nHydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. It is used topically for its anti-inflammatory effects which suppress the clinical manifestations of the disease in a wide range of disorders where inflammation is a prominent feature.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The cream should be topically applied 5 times per day for 5 days. Therapy should be initiated as early as possible after the first signs and symptoms.",

Thus vitamin C helps in faster recovery after surgery or any other trauma. Vitamin C quenches free radicals in the water based cellular components and thus acts as an antioxidant.Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver, adipose tissues, heart, muscles etc. It is an active antioxidant, which prevents oxidation of fat compounds. It works in synergy with Selenium.Vitamin K is a key anti-aging vitamin and it prevents heart disease and osteoporosis.Zinc is an important mineral that can actually rejuvenate the shrinking thymus gland that involves the working of the immune system. Zinc is a co-factor in over 100 enzymes of the body.Selenium: Apart from being a co-factor in antioxidant enzymes, Selenium by itself has potent antioxidant capabilities. So, it prevents aging and hardening of tissues through oxidation. Vitamin E and Selenium are synergistic and seem to potentiate each other's antioxidant activities.Copper is an important co-factor of a number of enzymes present in our body.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to \u03bc-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to \u03bc-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works.

Read more250 mg or 500 mg tablet: Acical tablet is used for the treatment or prevention of calcium depletion in patients in whom dietary measures are inadequate. Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Calcium Carbonate is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Calcium Carbonate containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.1000 mg tablet: Acical tablet is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.",
    "Pharmacology": "Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO3+2HCl = CaCl2+H2O+CO2. Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion. Up to 30% of the oral calcium load may be absorbed.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "250 mg or 500 mg tablet: Calcium Carbonate is always used orally and when used as an antacid the recommended doses for adults are equivalent to 540-2000 mg Calcium Carbonate per day, doses for children being half of those for adults. As a dietary supplement, such as for the prevention of osteoporosis, 1250-3750 mg Calcium Carbonate (500-1500 mg calcium) daily is recommended in general, but again this will need to be tailored to the individual patient depending on any specific disease such as Calcium deficiency, malabsorption or parathyroid function. In pregnancy and lactation the recommended daily dose of calcium is 1200-1500 mg. In chronic renal failure the doses used vary from 2.5-9.0 gm Calcium Carbonate per day and need to be adjusted according to the individual patient. To maximize effective phosphate binding in this context the Calcium Carbonate should be given with meals.1000 mg tablet: 2000-3000 mg tablet when symptoms occur; may be repeated hourly if needed or as directed by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "Calcium Carbonate may enhance the cardiac effects of digoxin and other cardiac glycosides, if systemic hypercalcaemia occurs. Calcium Carbonate may interfere with the absorption of concomitantly administered tetracycline preparations and in chronic renal failure modification of vitamin D therapy may be required to avoid hypercalcaemia when Calcium Carbonate is used as the primary phosphate binder.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism\nHypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome\nConcomitant digoxin therapy (requires careful monitoring of serum calcium level)\n\r\nWhen hypercalcaemia occurs, discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to return serum calcium concentrations to normal. Calcium salts should be used cautiously in patients with sarcoidosis, renal or cardiac disease, and in patients receiving cardiac glycosides.",
    "Side Effects": "Orally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcaemia is rarely produced by administration of calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Calcium containing drugs have been widely used in pregnancy by way of oral calcium supplementation or antacid therapy. Calcium Carbonate can be used in lactating women too.",

    "Pharmacology": "Calcium is used as a pharmacologic agent in humans almost entirely to remedy deficiency. Adequate calcium in the blood is so vital to a wide variety of bodily functions that our internal biochemistry will not tolerate a deficiency even for short periods. Vitamin-C is an essential component of the diet as man can not synthesize vitamin-C. It is a very powerful reducing agent. Vitamin-C plays an important part in the response of the body to stress. It is important in the defense against infection.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Children 3 to 7 years: \u00bd effervescent tablet daily.Adults & children above 7 years: 1 effervescent tablet daily. Dissolve 1 tablet in a glass of water before consumption.",
    "Interaction": "Potentially hazardous interactions:\n\nDigoxin, tetracycline, furosemide, pentagastrin.\nAminophylline, bleomycin, erythromycin, lactobionate, nafcillin, nitrofurantion, conjugated estrogens, salfafurazole, diethanolamine, chloramphenicol.\n\r\nPotentially useful interactions:\n\nVitamin-D, oxytocin and prostaglandins\nVitamin-C enhances iron absorption",

Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset.",
    "Side Effects": "In rare cases, mild gastrointestinal disturbances (bloating, diarrhea) can occur. In predisposed patients, prolonged treatment with high doses may promote the formation of calculi in the urinary tract.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Epidemiological studies with oral calcium have shown no increase in the teratogenic hazard to the fetus. Although supplemental calcium may be excreted in breast milk, the concentration is unlikely to be sufficient to produce any adverse effect on the neonate. Vitamin C\u00a0may be taken safely during pregnancy and lactation.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "For patients with mild hypercalciuria (exceeding 300 mg = 7.5 mmol/24 hours), with mild or moderate impairment of renal function or with a history of urinary concrements, monitoring of calcium excretion in the urine is required. If necessary, the dosage should be reduced or therapy should be discontinued. High doses of vitamin-D and derivatives should be avoided during treatment with Acical-C unless especially indicated.Since citrate salts have been reported to increase aluminium absorption, this medicine\u00a0\u00a0should be used with caution in patients with severely impaired renal function, especially those receiving aluminium-containing preparations. The sugar content should be taken into account by diabetic patients.",

    "Indications": "Aciclon is indicated for the treatment of Herpes simplex keratitis.",
    "Pharmacology": "Acyclovir is an antiviral agent which is highly active in vitro against Herpes simplex (HSV) types I and II and Varicella zoster viruses, but its toxicity to mammalian cells is low. Acyclovir is phosphorylated to the active compound Acyclovir triphosphate after entry into herpes infected cell. The \u00adfirst step in this process requires the presence of the viral-coded thymidine kinase. Acyclovir triphosphate acts as an inhibitor of and substrate for the herpes specifi\u00aded DNA polymerase preventing further viral DNA synthesis without affecting normal cellular processes.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The dosage for all age groups is the same. A 10 mm ribbon of the ointment should be placed inside the lower conjunctival sac \u00adfive times a day at approximately four hourly intervals. Treatment should continue for at least 3 days after healing",

    "Pharmacology": "Dexamethasone is a cortisone derivative whose high activity due to the presence of methyl group in the 16-alpha position and of a fluorine atom in the 9-alpha position. The result is that its anti-inflammatory activity is 30 times greater and its overall therapeutic effectiveness 8-10 times greater than that of hydrocortisone. Like other glucocorticoids, it is anti-allergic, anti-exudative and anti-proliferative. Therapeutic concentrations of Dexamethasone are found in both the cornea and aqueous humor 15-30 minutes after local application of single drop of 0.1% solution. These concentrations persist for 4-6 hours. The action of Dexamethasone is to inhibit the phospholipase A2, the first step in prostaglandin synthesis. Also, Dexamethasone inhibits the chemotactic infiltration of neutrophils into the site of inflammation.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Dexamethasone ophthalmic solution: Instill 1 drop into the conjunctival sac 3-5 times per day. Acute cases: up to 1 drop every hour if necessary.Dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment: Apply a small amount into the conjunctival sac 3-4 times per day. Slowly close your eyes without blinking.

    "Pharmacology": "Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic acid is rapidly distributed to bone. The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcemia demonstrated that the effect of Zoledronic acid is characterized by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In addition to its inhibitory activity against bone resorption, Zoledronic acid also possesses anti-tumour activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-pain activity, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour cells and synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.",
    "Interaction": "In clinical studies, Acidron has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without interactions. Caution is advised when Acidron are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Acidron is used in combination with thalidomide. Concomitant use of loop diuretics with Acidron increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Caution is indicated when Acidron is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.",
    "Contraindications": "The drug is contraindicated if patients have hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates; severe renal impairment (Creatinine clearance <30 ml/min); pregnancy and lactation.",
    "Side Effects": "The post-dose side-effects are headache, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, osteonecrosis of jaw, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, flu-like syndrome, hypocalcemia, myalgia, arthralgia and hypophosphataemia.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Zoledronic acid is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women. It is also not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Acidron. This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy. Adequate hydration can be achieved by the patient drinking two glasses of fluid (such as water) before and after the infusion. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium and potassium, as well as serum creatinine should be carefully monitored after initiating Acidron therapy. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia or hypomagnesemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. Moreover, careful renal function monitoring should be considered.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Bisphosphonate preparations",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store below 30\u00b0 C prior to opening. Protect from moisture and light. Acidron must be kept out of the reach and sight of children."

    "Pharmacology": "Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.",
    "Interaction": "Respite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Acifix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.",
    "Side Effects": "In general, Acifix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Acifix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "US FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Symptomatic response to therapy with Acifix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Acifix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\nA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\nPatients should be cautioned that Acifix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\nThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\nHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\nNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Acifix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\nCo-administration of atazanavir with Acifix is not recommended.\nTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\n\nHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Acifix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Acifix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Acifix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.",

    "Pharmacology": "Sparfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and kills many of the types of bacteria that can infect the breathing airways and lungs and has been shown in a large number of clinical trials to be safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial infections. It is found to be more effective in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against some gram positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureous), Mycobacteria and Chlamydia spp.Absorption: Quinoflox\u201a is well absorbed following oral administration with an absolute oral bioavailability of 92%. The mean maximum plasma sparfloxacin concentration following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 1.3 (\u00b10.2) \u00b5g/mL. The area under the curve following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 34 (\u00b16.8) \u00b5g\u00b7hr/mL. Steady-state plasma concentration was achieved on the first day by giving a loading dose that was double the daily dose. Maximum plasma concentrations for a 200 mg dose were also achieved between 3 to 6 hours after administration with a mean of about 4 hours. Oral absorption of sparfloxacin is unaffected by administration with milk or food, including high fat meals. Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide reduces the oral bioavailability of sparfloxacin by as much as 50%.Distribution: Upon reaching general circulation, Quinoflox\u201a distributes well into the body, as reflected by the large mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss ) of 3.9 (\u00b10.8) L/kg. Sparfloxacin exhibits low plasma protein binding in serum at about 45%. Sparfloxacin penetrates well into body fluids and tissues. Results of tissue and body fluid distribution studies demonstrated that oral administration of sparfloxacin produces sustained concentrations and that sparfloxacin concentrations in lower respiratory tract tissues and fluids generally exceed the corresponding plasma concentrations. The concentration of sparfloxacin in respiratory tissues (pulmonary parenchyma, bronchial wall, and bronchial mucosa) at 2 to 6 hours following standard oral dosing was approximately 3 to 6 times greater than the corresponding concentration in plasma. Concentrations in these respiratory tissues increase at up to 24 hours following dosing. Sparfloxacin is also highly concentrated into alveolar macrophages compared to plasma. Mean pleural effusion to plasma concentration ratios were 0.34 and 0.69 at 4 and 20 hours postdose, respectively.Metabolism: Quinoflox\u201a is metabolised by the liver, primarily by phase II glucuronidation, to form a glucuronide conjugate. Its metabolism does not utilize or interfere with cytochrome-mediated oxidation, in particular cytochrome P450.Excretion: The total body clearance and renal clearance of Quinoflox\u201a were 11.4 (\u00b13.5) and 1.5 (\u00b10.5) L/hr, respectively. Sparfloxacin is excreted in both the feces (50%) and urine (50%). Approximately 10% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in patients with normal renal function.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin\u201a in patients with normal renal function is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200 mg tablet should be taken every 24 hours for a total of 10 days of therapy (11 tablets). The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin\u201a in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200-mg tablet should be taken every 48 hours for a total of 9 days of therapy (6 tablets).",

    "Composition": "Each ml suspension contains Insulin Aspart (rDNA) 100 units (equivalent to 3.5 mg) as 30% soluble Insulin Aspart and 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine suspension",
    "Pharmacology": "30% Insulin Aspart and 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine (rDNA) is a human insulin analog suspension containing 30 % soluble Insulin Aspart and 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine crystals. This is a blood glucose lowering agent with an earlier onset and an intermediate duration of action. Insulin Aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast).Primary function of insulin, including Insulin Aspart, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, primarily by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.",
    "Interaction": "A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring.The following are examples that may increase the blood glucose lowering effect and susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.The following substances are examples that may reduce the blood glucose lowering effect: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, estrogens, progestogens, atypical antipsychotics and danazol. Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia.",
    "Contraindications": "Biphasic Insulin Aspart (rDNA) is contraindicated\n\nDuring episodes of hypoglycemia\nIn patients with hypersensitivity to Insulin Aspart or any of its excipients.",
    "Side Effects": "Side effects of Insulin Aspart are hypoglycemia, lipodystrophy, weight gain, peripheral edema.",

    "Pharmacology": "Ceftriaxone is a 3rd generation broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic. It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).",
    "Interaction": "No drug interactions have been reported.",
    "Contraindications": "Ceftriaxone should not be given to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
    "Side Effects": "Aciphin is generally well tolerated. A few side effects such as gastro-intestinal effects including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis and glossitis; cutaneous reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema and erythema multiforme; hematologic reactions including eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, anemia and neutropenia; hepatic reactions including elevations of SGOT or SGPT, bilirubinemia; CNS reactions including nervousness, confusion, sleep disturbances, headache, hyperactivity, convulsion, hypertonia and dizziness were reported. Local phlebitis occurs rarely following intravenous administration but can be minimized by slow injections over 2-4 minutes.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Its safety in human pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, it should not be used in pregnancy unless absolutely indicated. Low concentrations of Ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Ceftriaxone is administered to a lactating mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As with other cephalosporins, anaphylactic shock cannot be ruled out even if a thorough patient history is taken. Anaphylactic shock requires immediate countermeasures such as intravenous epinephrine followed by a glucocorticoid. In rare cases, shadows suggesting sludge have been detected by sonograms of the gallbladder. This condition was reversible on discontinuation or completion of Aciphin therapy. Even if such findings are associated with pain, conservative, nonsurgical management is recommended. During prolonged treatment the blood picture should be checked at regular intervals.",

    "Pharmacology": "Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.",
    "Interaction": "Respite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Acipra with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.",
    "Side Effects": "In general, Acipra is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Acipra may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "US FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Symptomatic response to therapy with Acipra does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Acipra 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\nA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\nPatients should be cautioned that Acipra gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\nThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\nHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\nNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Acipra 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\nCo-administration of atazanavir with Acipra is not recommended.\nTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\n\nHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Acipra, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Acipra. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Acipra 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.",

Absorption of Adapalene through human skin is low.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime) should be approached with caution. Exercise particular caution in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol or salicylic acid in combination with Aclene. If any of these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with Aclene until the effects of such preparations in skin have subsided. If combined use of both medications is important, it is better to use in two different times.",

    "Indications": "It is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",
    "Pharmacology": "Aclidinium bromide: Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.Formoterol fumarate: Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) (beta 2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "For oral inhalation only. Should be taken by inhaler device. 400 mcg/12 meg, twice daily (One inhalation capsule in the morning and one in the evening ). Do not take more than one inhalation twice daily.",
    "Interaction": "Use of other adrenergic by any route may potentiate the effect of Aclitol. Use with caution.\n\nXanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics or non-potassium sparing diuretics may potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes. Use with caution.\nDiuretics: Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non-potassium sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta2-agonists. Use with caution.\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate effect of formoterol fumarate on cardiovascular system.\nBeta-blockers: Use with caution and only when medically necessary.\nAnticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administrations of Aclitol with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.",
    "Contraindications": "Use of a long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonist (LABA), including formoterol fumarate, one of the active ingredients in this combination, without an inhaled corticosteroid is contraindicated in patients with asthma.\nHypersensitivity to aclidinium bromide or formoterol fumarate or to any component of this product.",
    "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions (incidence 3% and more common than with placebo) include: upper respiratory tract infection and headache.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Aclitol or its individual components, formoterol fumarate or aclidinium bromide, in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. There are no available data on the effects of aclidinium bromide, or formoterol fumarate on the breastfed child or on milk production or presence in human milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Asthma-related death: Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increase the risk of serious asthma-related events.\nDo not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or to treat acute symptoms.\nDo not use in combination with additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose.\nIf paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue Aclitol and institute alternative therapy.\nUse with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.\nBe alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.\nUse with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a physician immediately if symptoms occur.\nWorsening urinary retention may occur.

    "Pharmacology": "Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent topical corticosteroid. It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.",
    "Interaction": "Co-administered drugs that can inhibit CYP3A4 (eg ritonavir, itraconazole) have been shown to inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids leading to increased systemic exposure.",
    "Contraindications": "Rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis.

    "Side Effects": "As with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\nProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\nIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\nThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Aclobet is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.",

    "Pharmacology": "Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent corticosteroid. It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. In very resistant lesion, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation can be enhanced (if necessary) by occluding the treatment area with polythene. Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.Children: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).",
    "Interaction": "Neomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.",
    "Contraindications": "This medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.",
    "Side Effects": "As with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma might result. If this medication does enter the eye, the affected eye should be thoroughly washed with copious amount of water.",

If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.Children: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).",
    "Interaction": "Neomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.",
    "Contraindications": "This medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.",
    "Side Effects": "As with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma might result. If this medication does enter the eye, the affected eye should be thoroughly washed with copious amount of water.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Clobetasol / Clobetasone & Combined Preparations",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store below 25\u00b0C temperature. Do not freeze. Keep out of reach of children."

    "generic_id": "6042",
    "Indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Acmegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Acmegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
    "Pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.Absorption and Distribution: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.Metabolism and Excretion: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Erectile dysfunction: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
    "Interaction": "Acmegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Acmegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Acmegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Acmegra concentrations when coadministered with Acmegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Acmegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Acmegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Acmegra AUC. Acmegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Acmegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Acmegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Acmegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Acmegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Acmegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Acmegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Acmegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Acmegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Acmegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Acmegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Acmegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Acmegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Acmegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Acmegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",
    "Contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",
    "Side Effects": "Body as a whole: face edema, photosensitivity reaction, shock, asthenia, pain, chills, accidental fall, abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chest pain, accidental injury.Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, AV block, migraine, syncope, tachycardia, palpitation,hypotension, postural hypotension, myocardial ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, cardiac arrest, heart failure, abnormal electrocardiogram, cardiomyopathy.Digestive: vomiting, glossitis, colitis, dysphagia, gastritis, gastroenteritis, esophagitis, stomatitis, dry mouth, liver function tests abnormal, rectal hemorrhage, gingivitis.Hemic and Lymphatic: anemia and leukopenia.Metabolic and Nutritional: thirst, edema, gout, unstable diabetes, hyperglycemia, peripheral edema, hyperuricemia, hypoglycemic reaction, hypernatremia.Musculoskeletal: arthritis, arthrosis, myalgia, tendon rupture, tenosynovitis, bone pain,myasthenia, synovitis.Nervous: ataxia, hypertonia, neuralgia, neuropathy, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo, depression, insomnia, somnolence, abnormal dreams, reflexes decreased, hyperesthesia.Respiratory: asthma, dyspnea, laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, sputum increased, cough increased.Skin and Appendages: urticaria, herpes simplex, pruritus, sweating, skin ulcer, contact dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis.Special Senses: sudden decrease or loss of hearing, mydriasis, conjunctivitis, photophobia, tinnitus, eye pain, ear pain, eye hemorrhage, cataract, dry eyes.Urogenital: cystitis, nocturia, urinary frequency, breast enlargement, urinary incontinence, abnormal ejaculation, genital edema and anorgasmia.Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular: Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of Acmegra. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Acmegra without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Acmegra and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Acmegra, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.Nervous: seizure, seizure recurrence, anxiety, and transient global amnesia.Urogenital: prolonged erection, priapism and hematuria.Special Senses: diplopia, temporary vision loss/decreased vision, ocular redness or bloodshot appearance, ocular burning, ocular swelling/pressure, increased intraocular pressure, retinal vascular disease or bleeding, vitreous detachment/traction, paramacular edema and epistaxis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sildenafil in pregnant women. Sildenafil is not indicated for use by women. In animal study shows that Sildenafil has no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).Consideration should be given to the following:\n\nPatients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.\nIn those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose.\nIn those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.\nSafety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.\nAcmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications.\nPatients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Acmegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Acmegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted.\nThe safety of Acmegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.\nAcmegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).\nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of Acmegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.\n\r\nThere is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.\n\nPatients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;\nPatients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110);\nPatients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;\nPatients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases);\nPatients with sickle cell or related anemias.\n\r\nProlonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Acmegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Acmegra dosage is recommended.",

    "generic_id": "6043",
    "Indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Acmegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Acmegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
    "Pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.Absorption and Distribution: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.Metabolism and Excretion: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Erectile dysfunction: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
    "Interaction": "Acmegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Acmegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Acmegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Acmegra concentrations when coadministered with Acmegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Acmegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Acmegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Acmegra AUC. Acmegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Acmegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Acmegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Acmegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Acmegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Acmegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Acmegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Acmegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Acmegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Acmegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Acmegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Acmegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Acmegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Acmegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Acmegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",
    "Contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",
    "Side Effects": "Body as a whole: face edema, photosensitivity reaction, shock, asthenia, pain, chills, accidental fall, abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chest pain, accidental injury.Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, AV block, migraine, syncope, tachycardia, palpitation,hypotension, postural hypotension, myocardial ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, cardiac arrest, heart failure, abnormal electrocardiogram, cardiomyopathy.Digestive: vomiting, glossitis, colitis, dysphagia, gastritis, gastroenteritis, esophagitis, stomatitis, dry mouth, liver function tests abnormal, rectal hemorrhage, gingivitis.Hemic and Lymphatic: anemia and leukopenia.Metabolic and Nutritional: thirst, edema, gout, unstable diabetes, hyperglycemia, peripheral edema, hyperuricemia, hypoglycemic reaction, hypernatremia.Musculoskeletal: arthritis, arthrosis, myalgia, tendon rupture, tenosynovitis, bone pain,myasthenia, synovitis.Nervous: ataxia, hypertonia, neuralgia, neuropathy, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo, depression, insomnia, somnolence, abnormal dreams, reflexes decreased, hyperesthesia.Respiratory: asthma, dyspnea, laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, sputum increased, cough increased.Skin and Appendages: urticaria, herpes simplex, pruritus, sweating, skin ulcer, contact dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis.Special Senses: sudden decrease or loss of hearing, mydriasis, conjunctivitis, photophobia, tinnitus, eye pain, ear pain, eye hemorrhage, cataract, dry eyes.Urogenital: cystitis, nocturia, urinary frequency, breast enlargement, urinary incontinence, abnormal ejaculation, genital edema and anorgasmia.Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular: Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of Acmegra. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Acmegra without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Acmegra and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Acmegra, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.Nervous: seizure, seizure recurrence, anxiety, and transient global amnesia.Urogenital: prolonged erection, priapism and hematuria.Special Senses: diplopia, temporary vision loss/decreased vision, ocular redness or bloodshot appearance, ocular burning, ocular swelling/pressure, increased intraocular pressure, retinal vascular disease or bleeding, vitreous detachment/traction, paramacular edema and epistaxis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sildenafil in pregnant women. Sildenafil is not indicated for use by women. In animal study shows that Sildenafil has no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).Consideration should be given to the following:\n\nPatients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.\nIn those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose.\nIn those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.\nSafety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.\nAcmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications.\nPatients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Acmegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Acmegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted.\nThe safety of Acmegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.\nAcmegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).\nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of Acmegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.\n\r\nThere is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.\n\nPatients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;\nPatients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110);\nPatients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;\nPatients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases);\nPatients with sickle cell or related anemias.\n\r\nProlonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure.

    "Pharmacology": "Dapsone has both anti-infammatory and antimicrobial properties. A combination of these activities may account for its efcacy in acne. Anti-infammatory efects include inhibition of neutrophil myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase activity, suppression of hypochlorous acid production, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, suppression of neutrophil activity, and inhibition of chemoattractant-induced signal transduction. Antimicrobial activity, similar to that of sulfones and sulfonamides, is by inhibition of bacterial dihydropteroate synthase in the folic acid metabolic pathway. This mechanism is efective against microorganisms synthesizing their own folic acid. In vitro susceptibility testing has demonstrated some activity for Dapsone against Propionibacterium species, including Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes).",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Apply once daily (7.5% gel) and twice daily (5% gel) after the skin is gently washed and patted dry\nApply approximately a pea-sized amount of gel in a thin layer to the acne affected area\nRub the gel gently and completely\nIf there is no improvement after 12 weeks, treatment with this gel should be reassessed\nDapsone gel maybe gritty with visible drug substance particles\nWash hands after application",
    "Interaction": "Trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (TMP/ SMX) increases the systemic level of Acnesone and its metabolites. Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as Acnesone may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration.",
    "Contraindications": "Those who are hypersensitive to Dapsone.",
    "Side Effects": "Oiliness/peeiing, dryness and erythema at the application site.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Although systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application Dapsone Gel is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration, it is known that dapsone is excreted in human milk.

    "Indications": "Acnev cream is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older.",
    "Pharmacology": "Clascoterone (cortexolone 17 \u03b1-propionate) is a novel antagonist of androgen receptors. It binds to androgen receptors with high affinity. By competing with androgens for binding to androgen receptors, Clascoterone works by blocking the androgen receptor signaling cascades that promotes acne pathogenesis such as sebaceous gland proliferation, excess sebum production and inflammatory pathways.Acne is a multifactorial skin condition characterized by excess sebum production, epithelial hyperkeratinization, proliferation of the skin commensal bacteria, and inflammation. Circulating and locally synthesized natural ligands, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), serve as causative factors in both males and females. Upon binding of DHT, the DHT-androgen receptor complex dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes involved in acne pathogenesis, including proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes, excess sebum production, and inflammatory cytokine production. Clascoterone is a potent antagonist at ARs and competes for androgens in binding to the receptor, thereby inhibiting downstream signalling of ARs that promote acne.Androgenetic alopecia is also an androgen-dependent and highly genetic condition. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to ARs expressed on dermal papilla cells (DPC) in the scalp to induce AR-mediated transcription of genes that contribute to androgenic alopecia. By blocking the interaction between DHT and aARs, clascoterone inhibits AR-regulated transcription and DHT-induced IL-6 synthesis.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Clean the affected area gently then apply a thin uniform layer (approximately 1 gm) of Clascoterone cream twice per day in the morning and evening to the affected area. Avoid accidental transfer of Clascoterone cream into eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, this should be rinsed thoroughly with water or as directed by physician.Use in Children and Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Clascoterone cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have not been established in pediatric patients under 12 years of age",
    "Interaction": "No clinical study evaluating the drug interaction of Acnev cream has been conducted.",
    "Contraindications": "Data of contraindication of clascoterone cream in not available.",
    "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions occurring in 7% to 12% of patients are erythema/ reddening, pruritus, and scaling/dryness. Additionally, >3% of patients may suffer from edema, stinging and burning.Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials, 1421 subjects 12 years and older with facial acne vulgaris applied Acnev cream or vehicle twice daily for 12 weeks. Overall, 62% of the subjects were female, and 38% were male, 91% of the patients were Caucasian, and the mean age was 19.7 years.Local skin reactions (edema, erythema/redness, pruritus, scaling/dryness, skin atrophy, stinging/burning, striae rubrea, telangiectasia) were observed during the 12-week treatment and occurred in a similar percentage of subjects treated with vehicle.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There is no available data on clascoterone cream use in pregnant women to evaluate a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

    "Indications": "Acora, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.",
    "Pharmacology": "Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. The P2Y12 receptor couples with G\u03b1i2 and other Gi proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Gi mediated signalling also activates PI3K, Akt, Rap1b, and potassium channels. The downstream effects of these activities mediate hemostasis and lead to platelet aggregation. Antagonism of the P2Y12 receptor reduces development of occlusive thromboses, which can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Patients taking Ticagrelor should also take a daily low maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75-150 mg unless specifically contraindicated. Acute coronary syndromes: Ticagrelor treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and then continued at 90 mg twice daily. Treatment with Ticagrelor twice daily is recommended for 12 months in ACS patients unless discontinuation is clinically indicated. History of myocardial infarction: Ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily is the recommended dose when an extended treatment is required for patients with a history of MI of at least one year and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment may be started without interruption as continuation therapy after the initial one-year treatment with ticagrelor or another adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor therapy in ACS patients with a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment can also be initiated up to 2 years from the MI, or within one year after stopping previous ADP receptor inhibitor treatment. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond 3 years of extended treatment. Switch therapy: If a switch is needed, the first dose of ticagrelor should be administered 24 hours following the last dose of the other antiplatelet medication. Missed dose: A patient who misses a dose of ticagrelor should take only one tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time. Elderly: No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. No information is available concerning the treatment of patients on renal dialysis and therefore ticagrelor is not recommended in these patients. Hepatic impairment: Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use in these patients is therefore contraindicated. Only limited information is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment is not recommended, but ticagrelor should be used with caution. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Pediatric population: The safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in hildren below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available. Ticagrelor can be administered with or without food. Contra-indications, warnings etc.",
    "Interaction": "Effects of medicinal and other products on Acora; CYP3A4 inhibitors: Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir) inhibitors with Acora is contraindicated. CYP3A inducers: Co-administration of Acora with potent CYP3A inducers (rifampicin)may decrease exposure and efficacy of Acora, therefore, their concomitant use with Acora is discouraged. Cyclosporine (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor): No data are available on concomitant use of Acora with other active substances that also are potent P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, quinidine) that also may increase Acora exposure. If the association cannot be avoided, their concomitant use should be made with caution. Effects of Acora on other medicinal products: Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4: The concomitant use of Acora with doses of simvastatin or lovastatin greater than 40 mg is not recommended. Atorvastatin: Co-administration of atorvastatin and Acora increased atorvastatin acid Cmax by 23% and AUC by 36%. Similar increases in AUC and Cmax were observed for all atorvastatin acid metabolites. These increases are not considered clinically significant. Acora is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of Acora and CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (i.e. cisapride or ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as Acora may increase the exposure to this medicinal products. P-gp substrates (including digoxin, cyclosporine): Appropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring is recommended when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent medicinal products like digoxin concomitantly with Acora. Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9: Co-administration of Acora with tolbutamide resulted in no change in the plasma levels of either medicinal product, which suggests that Acora is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor and unlikely to alter the CYP2C9 mediated metabolism of medicinal products like warfarin and tolbutamide. Oral contraceptives: No clinically relevant effect on oral contraceptive efficacy is expected when levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is co-administered with Acora. Medicinal products known to induce bradycardia: No evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions were observed in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more medicinal products known to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil, and 4% digoxin). Other concomitant therapy: No evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions with these medicinal products (acetylsalicylic acid, proton pump inhibitors, statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) was observed. Due to potential pharmacodynamic interactions, caution should be exercised with the concomitant administration of Acora with medicinal products (heparin, enoxaparin or desmopressin) known to alter haemostasis. Due to reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities with SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram), caution is advised when administering SSRIs with Acora as this may increase the risk of bleeding.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, active pathological bleeding, history of intracranial haemorrhage, severe hepatic impairment.",
    "Side Effects": "Very Common: Blood disorder bleedings, Hyperuricaemia, Dyspnoea. Common: Gout/Gouty Arthritis, Dizziness, Syncope, Headache, Vertigo, Hypotension, Respiratory system bleedings, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Dyspepsia, Constipation, Subcutaneous or dermal bleeding, Rash, Pruritus, Urinary tract bleeding, Blood creatinine increased, Postprocedural haemorrhage, Traumatic bleedings. Uncommon: Tumour bleedings, Hypersensitivity including angioedema, Confusion, Intracranial haemorrhage, Eye haemorrhage, Ear haemorrhage, Retroperitoneal haemorrhage, Muscular bleedings.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Ticagrelor is not recommended during pregnancy. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ticagrelor and its active metabolites in milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ticagrelor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Bleeding risk: The use of Acora in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. If clinically indicated, Acora should be used with caution in the following patient groups; Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation disorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). Antifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa therapy may increase haemostasis. Acora may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been identified and controlled.Surgery: Patients should be advised to inform\u00a0 physicians and dentists that they are taking Acora before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and the antiplatelet effect is not desired, Acora should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery.Patients with prior ischaemic stroke: ACS patients with prior ischaemic stroke can be treated with Acora for up to 12 months. Patients at risk for bradycardic events: Due to the limited clinical experience, Acora should be used with caution in these patients.Dyspnoea: Patients with asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have an increased absolute risk of experiencing dyspnoea with Acora. Acora should be used with caution in patients with a history of asthma and/or COPD. Creatinine elevations: Creatinine levels may increase during treatment with Acora. In patients with ACS, it is recommended that renal function is also checked one month after initiating the treatment with Acora, paying special attention to patients \u226575 years, patients with moderate/severe renal impairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Uric acid increase: Hyperuricaemia may occur during treatment with Acora. Caution is advised in patients with a history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. Other: Based on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and relative efficacy of Acora compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of Acora and high maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (>300 mg) is not recommended.Premature discontinuation: Premature discontinuation with any antiplatelet therapy, including Acora, could result in an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death or MI due to the patient\u2019s underlying disease. Therefore, premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.",

    "Pharmacology": "Ambroxol is the active metabolite of bromhexine and it has been proven that this metabolite possesses a greater bronchosecretolytic effect than bromhexine. It improves sputum rheology by hydrating mechanism leading to liquefaction of mucus in the lumen of respiratory tract, thus facilitating expectoration of mucus and reducing dyspnea. It stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells, thus contributing to the lowering of superficial tension in the alveoli. It also reduces bronchial hyperactivity.

In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Acos is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
    "Pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:\n\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nOther microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila\nAnaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",
    "Interaction": "Antacid: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should\u00a0be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic\u00a0interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of\u00a0carbamazepine or its active metabolite. Cyclosporin: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics\u00a0interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from\u00a0pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin\u00a0and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations\u00a0is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted\u00a0accordingly. Digoxin: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the\u00a0metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant\u00a0azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and\u00a0digoxin levels monitored. Ergot derivatives: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism,\u00a0azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. Methylprednisolone: In a\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on\u00a0the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. Theophylline: There is no evidence of any\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy\u00a0volunteers.

Warfarin: In a\u00a0pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a\u00a0single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Acos and warfarin may\u00a0be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely\u00a0performed. Terfenadine: Acos did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine\u00a0administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did\u00a0not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the\u00a0steady state dosing of terfenadine.",
    "Contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
    "Side Effects": "Acos is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.",

    "Indications": "Acos is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Acos is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
    "Pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:\n\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nOther microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila\nAnaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",
    "Interaction": "Antacid: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should\u00a0be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic\u00a0interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of\u00a0carbamazepine or its active metabolite. Cyclosporin: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics\u00a0interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from\u00a0pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin\u00a0and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations\u00a0is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted\u00a0accordingly. Digoxin: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the\u00a0metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant\u00a0azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and\u00a0digoxin levels monitored. Ergot derivatives: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism,\u00a0azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. Methylprednisolone: In a\u00a0pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on\u00a0the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone.

    "Pharmacology": "Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.Absorption: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.Distribution: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.Excretion: 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and Children over 8 years: 250-500 mg every six hours for mild to moderate infections. This may be increased upto 4 gm. or more daily in severe cases.Elderly: No special dosage recommendation. Erythromycin may be administered if desired, three times daily or twice daily by giving one-third or half of the total daily requirement 8 hourly or 12 hourly respectively. Children aged 2 to 8 years: 250 mg. every six hours or 30-50 mg/kg body weight per day divided into four equal dosage. Infants and Children upto 2 years: 500 mg. in divided doses or 30-50 mg/kg body weight in divided doses.",
    "Interaction": "Recent data from studies of Acryth reveals that its use in patients who are receiving high dosage of theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In such cases this dose of theophylline should be reduced.",
    "Contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to Erythromycin.",
    "Side Effects": "Allergic reactions are rare and mild although anaphylaxis has occurred. Occasionally there is abdominal discomfort after oral administration, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. This discomfort usually subsides after a few days without it being necessary to reduce the dosage.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Clinical and Laboratory studies have been shown no evidence in human of teratogenicity or toxicity. However, caution should be exercised when prescribing this drug to pregnant patients and lactating mothers since erythromycin crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Acryth should be given with care in patients with impaired hepatic function, as Acryth is excreted principally in the bile.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

By intermolecular association with Paracetamol, Caffeine increases the solubility and transmembrane permeation of Paracetamol. In addition, Caffeine increases the pain threshold and tolerance of pain. Caffeine has also an intrinsic power to raise vessel tone in the brain, which provides another benefit to treat migraine and headache.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult dose: 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours. Maximum dose: 8 tablets daily. Child dose: Not recommended for children below 12 years.",
    "Interaction": "May reduce serum levels with anticonvulsants (e.g. phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine). May enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarins with prolonged use. Accelerated absorption with metoclopramide and domperidone. May increase serum levels with probenecid. May increase serum levels of chloramphenicol. May reduce absorption with colestyramine within 1 hr of admin. May cause severe hypothermia with phenothiazine.",
    "Contraindications": "Paracetamol is contraindicated in patients with severe renal function impairment and hepatic disease (Viral Hepatitis). Known hypersensitivity to paracetamol or caffeine.",
    "Side Effects": "Side effects of paracetamol are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnant mothers should consult with doctors before taking Paracetamol & Caffeine. Paracetamol & Caffeine can be taken whilst breast feeding.",

    "Pharmacology": "Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody of theimmunoglobulin IgG1K (gamma 1, kappa) subclass. Tocilizumab binds to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T-cells and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phaseprotein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.",

Read moreActical tablet is used to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels in people who do not get enough calcium from their diets. It may be used to treat conditions caused by low calcium levels such as bone loss (osteoporosis), weak bones (osteomalacia, rickets), decreased activity of the parathyroid gland (hypoparathyroidism) and a certain muscle disease (latent tetany). It may also be used in certain patients to make sure they are getting enough calcium (e.g. postmenopausal).",
    "Composition": "Each tablet contains-\n\nCalcium Citrate USP 1200 mg equivalent to Calcium 252 mg\nCalcitriol EP 0.25 mcg",
    "Pharmacology": "Calcium plays a very important role in the body. It is necessary for normal functioning of nerves, cells, muscle, and bone. If there is not enough calcium in the blood, then the body will take calcium from bones, thereby weakening bones. Having the right amount of calcium is important for building and keeping strong bones. Calcium citrate is well absorbed on an empty stomach and does not constipate. Calcium citrate is less dependent on stomach acid for absorption.Calcitriol is the most active known form of vitamin D 3 in stimulating intestinal calcium transport. It is normally formed in the kidneys from its immediate precursor, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. In physiological amounts it augments the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and plays a significant part in the regulation of bone mineralization. The defective production of calcitriol in chronic renal failure contributes to the abnormalities of mineral metabolism found in that disorder. The biological effects of calcitriol are mediated by the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear hormone receptor expressed in most cell types and functioning as a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds to DNA sites to modify the expression of target genes. Oral administration of Calcitriol to patients with chronic renal failure compensates for impaired endogenous production of calcitriol which is decreased when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 ml/min. Consequently, intestinal malabsorption of calcium and phosphate and the resulting hypocalcemia are improved, thereby reversing the signs and symptoms of bone disease. In patients with established post-menopausal osteoporosis, Calcitriol increases calcium absorption, elevates circulating levels of calcitriol and reduces vertebral fracture frequency.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "1-4 tablets daily with or without food depending on clinical situation or as directed by the registered physician.",
    "Interaction": "Reduced absorption of tetracyclines, quinolones and oral biphosphates with concurrent calcium use. Calcium absorption may be reduced by corticosteroids. Increased risk of hypercalcaemia and metabolic alkalosis with thiazide diuretics. High blood calcium level may increase the efect of cardiac glycosides. Reduced erlotinib efcacy with calcium. Increased risk of hypercalcaemia with paricalcitol. Enzyme inducing antiepileptics increases the metabolism of vitamin D. Fatal encephalopathy can occur in patients with renal failure when given calcium citrate and aluminium products concurrently due to marked rise in aluminium levels.",
    "Contraindications": "This drug is contraindicated for the patients with hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria, hypophosphatemia.",
    "Side Effects": "The side efects of Actical are-constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria, headache, muscle weakness.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category C. It should be used as directed by the registered physician during pregnancy and lactation.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "This medication should be used with cautions in the following conditions- hypercalcaemia, malabsorption syndrome, heart disease, kidney disease, kidney stones, certain immune system disorder (sarcoidosis), liver disease, certain bowel diseases (Crohn's disease).",

    "Indications": "Actidex is indicated in symptomatic treatment of pain and inflammation of mild or moderate intensity, such as musculo-skeletal pain, menstrual pain, & dental pain.",
    "Pharmacology": "Dexketoprofen is the S(+)-enantiomer of Ketoprofen and is responsible for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of Ketoprofen. The inactive R(-)-enantiomer does not contribute to the therapeutic properties of Ketoprofen but adds to the metabolic load. Dexketoprofen has been formulated as a trometamol salt. Its high solubility in water means a rapid absorption through the gut wall which results in a more rapid onset of action than Ketoprofen. Peak plasma concentrations are attained more quickly than other widely used analgesics with an onset of action of 30 minutes. Dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the tmax for the S-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/L are reached after administration of Dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25 mg, respectively. From 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. No R(-)-Ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of Dexketoprofen [S(+)-Ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the S(+)-enantiomer in humans. The anti-inflammatory potency of Dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of Ketoprofen.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The dose of Dexketoprofen 25 mg tablets depends on the type, severity, and duration of pain. The recommended dose is generally 1 tablet every 8 hours, with no more than 3 tablets daily. The elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment should start treatment with a total daily dose of no more than 2 tablets. Normally it is recommended to take the tablets with food. In the case of acute pain, it is recommended that tablets be taken at least 30 minutes before meals. Dexketoprofen is not recommended for children.",

    "Composition": "Each tablet contains-\n\nCalcium Folinate Hydrate BP 6.249 mg equivalent to Folinic Acid 5 mg.\nCalcium Folinate Hydrate BP 18.746 mg equivalent to Folinic Acid 15 mg.",
    "Pharmacology": "This is the preparation of Calcium Folinate Hydrate which is calcium salt of folinic acid (5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid). It is a metabolite and active form of folic acid that is involved as a cofactor for 1-carbon transfer reactions in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidines of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective DNA synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Because of its ready conversion to other tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives, Folinate is a potent antidote for both hematopoietic and reticuloendothelia toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, (e.g. methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim). It is postulated that in some cancers, folinate enters and \"rescues\" normal cells from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in preference to tumour cells, because of a difference in membrane transport mechanisms; this principle is the basis of high-dose methotrexate therapy with \"Folinate rescue\".",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Folinic Acid rescue: Folinic Acid rescue should begin as soon as possible after an inadvertent overdosage and within 24 hours of methotrexate administration when there is delayed excretion. There are no fixed guidelines regarding the dose of methotrexate that triggers an automatic subsequent Folinic Acid administration, since tolerance to this folate antagonist depends on various factors. The dose of methotrexate varies, nevertheless folinate rescue is necessary when methotrexate is given at doses exceeding 500 mg/m2 and has to be considered with doses of 100 mg-500 mg/m2. Folinic Acid rescue treatment should commence approximately 24 hours after the beginning of methotrexate infusion. Dosage regimens vary depending upon the dose of methotrexate administered. In general, Folinic Acid should be administered at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses.The recommended dose of Folinic Acid to counteract hematologic toxicity from folic acid antagonists with less affinity for mammalian dihydrofolate reductase than methotrexate (i.e., trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) is substantially less and 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day has been recommended.Neutralising the immediate toxic effects of folic acid antagonists: If overdosage of methotrexate is suspected, the dose of Folinic Acid should be equal to or greater than the dose of methotrexate and should be administered within one hour of the methotrexate administration.Megaloblastic anaemia (folate deficiency): 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day.Use in children and adolescents: The safety and efficacy of folinic acid in children and adolescents have not beenestablished.",
    "Interaction": "Folinates given in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbitone, phenytoin and primidone and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible patients. Caution is required during concurrent administration of calcium folinate with fluoropyrimidine as this has been associated with seizures and syncope.",
    "Contraindications": "Folinic Acid is contraindicated to patients with known hypersensitivity to calcium folinate or any other components of this product. It is also contraindicated in pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemia where vitamin B12 is deficient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take calcium folinate tablets.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects of Actifol are mucositis, stomatitis, leukopenia and/or diarrhea, which may be dose-limiting.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies conducted in pregnant women. Folinic Acid should only be used in pregnant women if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcium folinate is administered to a nursing mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Actifol should only be used with methotrexate or 5-FU under the direct supervision of a clinician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the treatment of inadvertent overdosage of a folic acid antagonist, folinate should be administered as soon as possible; if a period exceeding 4 hours intervenes, the treatment may not be effective. In general, Actifol should not be given simultaneously with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to abort clinical toxicity as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified. Flowever, Actifol given concurrently with folate antagonists, such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim does not inhibit their antibacterial activity. Measures to ensure the prompt excretion of methotrexate are important as part of Actifol Rescue Therapy. These measures include:\n\nAlkalinisation of urine so that the urinary pH is greater than 7.0 before methotrexate infusion (to increase solubility of methotrexate and its metabolites).\nMaintenance of urine output of 1800-2000 cc/m2/24 hour by increased oral or intravenous fluids on days 2, 3 and 4 following methotrexate therapy.\nPlasma methotrexate concentration, BUN and creatinine should be measured on days 2, 3 and 4. These measures must be continued until the plasma methotrexate level is less than 10-7 molar.",

In general, Folinic Acid should be administered at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses.The recommended dose of Folinic Acid to counteract hematologic toxicity from folic acid antagonists with less affinity for mammalian dihydrofolate reductase than methotrexate (i.e., trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) is substantially less and 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day has been recommended.Neutralising the immediate toxic effects of folic acid antagonists: If overdosage of methotrexate is suspected, the dose of Folinic Acid should be equal to or greater than the dose of methotrexate and should be administered within one hour of the methotrexate administration.Megaloblastic anaemia (folate deficiency): 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day.Use in children and adolescents: The safety and efficacy of folinic acid in children and adolescents have not beenestablished.",
    "Interaction": "Folinates given in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbitone, phenytoin and primidone and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible patients. Caution is required during concurrent administration of calcium folinate with fluoropyrimidine as this has been associated with seizures and syncope.",
    "Contraindications": "Folinic Acid is contraindicated to patients with known hypersensitivity to calcium folinate or any other components of this product. It is also contraindicated in pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemia where vitamin B12 is deficient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take calcium folinate tablets.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects of Actifol are mucositis, stomatitis, leukopenia and/or diarrhea, which may be dose-limiting.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies conducted in pregnant women. Folinic Acid should only be used in pregnant women if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcium folinate is administered to a nursing mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Actifol should only be used with methotrexate or 5-FU under the direct supervision of a clinician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the treatment of inadvertent overdosage of a folic acid antagonist, folinate should be administered as soon as possible; if a period exceeding 4 hours intervenes, the treatment may not be effective. In general, Actifol should not be given simultaneously with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to abort clinical toxicity as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified. Flowever, Actifol given concurrently with folate antagonists, such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim does not inhibit their antibacterial activity. Measures to ensure the prompt excretion of methotrexate are important as part of Actifol Rescue Therapy. These measures include:\n\nAlkalinisation of urine so that the urinary pH is greater than 7.0 before methotrexate infusion (to increase solubility of methotrexate and its metabolites).\nMaintenance of urine output of 1800-2000 cc/m2/24 hour by increased oral or intravenous fluids on days 2, 3 and 4 following methotrexate therapy.\nPlasma methotrexate concentration, BUN and creatinine should be measured on days 2, 3 and 4. These measures must be continued until the plasma methotrexate level is less than 10-7 molar.",

    "Pharmacology": "Alteplase is a serine protease responsible for fibrin-enhanced conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. It produces limited conversion of plasminogen in the absence of fibrin. When introduced into the systemic circulation at pharmacologic concentration, alteplase binds to fibrin in a thrombus and converts the entrapped plasminogen to plasmin. This initiates local fibrinolysis with limited systemic proteolysis.Pharmacodynamics: Following administration of 100 mg Alteplase, there is a decrease (16%-36%) in circulating fibrinogen. In a controlled trial, 8 of 73 patients (11%) receiving Alteplase (1.25 mg/kg body weight over 3 hours) experienced a decrease in fibrinogen to below 100 mg/dL.Pharmacokinetics: Alteplase in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is rapidly cleared from the plasma with an initial half-life of less than 5 minutes. There is no difference in the dominant initial plasma half-life between the 3-hour and accelerated regimens for AMI. The plasma clearance of alteplase is 380-570 mL/min, primarily mediated by the liver. The initial volume of distribution approximates plasma volume.",
    "Interaction": "The interaction of Actilyse with other cardioactive or cerebroactive drugs has not been studied.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

    "generic_id": "28501",
    "Indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Activa to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Activa is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
    "Pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.Absorption and Distribution: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.Metabolism and Excretion: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Erectile dysfunction: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
    "Interaction": "Activa metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Activa clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Activa clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Activa concentrations when coadministered with Activa (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Activa was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Activa systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Activa Cmax and a 210% increase in Activa AUC. Activa had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Activa clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Activa Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Activa plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Activa were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Activa was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Activa had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Activa has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Activa levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Activa at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Activa AUC and a 55% decrease in Activa Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Activa. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Activa. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Activa pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Activa, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",
    "Contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",
    "Side Effects": "Body as a whole: face edema, photosensitivity reaction, shock, asthenia, pain, chills, accidental fall, abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chest pain, accidental injury.Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, AV block, migraine, syncope, tachycardia, palpitation,hypotension, postural hypotension, myocardial ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, cardiac arrest, heart failure, abnormal electrocardiogram, cardiomyopathy.Digestive: vomiting, glossitis, colitis, dysphagia, gastritis, gastroenteritis, esophagitis, stomatitis, dry mouth, liver function tests abnormal, rectal hemorrhage, gingivitis.Hemic and Lymphatic: anemia and leukopenia.Metabolic and Nutritional: thirst, edema, gout, unstable diabetes, hyperglycemia, peripheral edema, hyperuricemia, hypoglycemic reaction, hypernatremia.Musculoskeletal: arthritis, arthrosis, myalgia, tendon rupture, tenosynovitis, bone pain,myasthenia, synovitis.Nervous: ataxia, hypertonia, neuralgia, neuropathy, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo, depression, insomnia, somnolence, abnormal dreams, reflexes decreased, hyperesthesia.Respiratory: asthma, dyspnea, laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, sputum increased, cough increased.Skin and Appendages: urticaria, herpes simplex, pruritus, sweating, skin ulcer, contact dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis.Special Senses: sudden decrease or loss of hearing, mydriasis, conjunctivitis, photophobia, tinnitus, eye pain, ear pain, eye hemorrhage, cataract, dry eyes.Urogenital: cystitis, nocturia, urinary frequency, breast enlargement, urinary incontinence, abnormal ejaculation, genital edema and anorgasmia.Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular: Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of Activa. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Activa without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Activa and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Activa, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.Nervous: seizure, seizure recurrence, anxiety, and transient global amnesia.Urogenital: prolonged erection, priapism and hematuria.Special Senses: diplopia, temporary vision loss/decreased vision, ocular redness or bloodshot appearance, ocular burning, ocular swelling/pressure, increased intraocular pressure, retinal vascular disease or bleeding, vitreous detachment/traction, paramacular edema and epistaxis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sildenafil in pregnant women. Sildenafil is not indicated for use by women. In animal study shows that Sildenafil has no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.Before prescribing Activa, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Activa, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).Consideration should be given to the following:\n\nPatients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.\nIn those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose.\nIn those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.\nSafety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.\nActiva has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications.\nPatients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Activa. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Activa, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted.\nThe safety of Activa is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.\nActiva should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).\nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of Activa with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.\n\r\nThere is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Activa, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Activa, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Activa - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Activa in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.\n\nPatients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;\nPatients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110);\nPatients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;\nPatients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases);\nPatients with sickle cell or related anemias.\n\r\nProlonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Activa. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Activa is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Activa are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Activa exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Activa (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Activa dosage is recommended.",

While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Activa, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Activa - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Activa in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.\n\nPatients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;\nPatients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110);\nPatients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;\nPatients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases);\nPatients with sickle cell or related anemias.\n\r\nProlonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Activa. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Activa is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Activa are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Activa exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Activa (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Activa dosage is recommended.",

Read moreAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:\u03b2 carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with \u03b2 carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
    "Pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this\u00a0tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.",
    "Interaction": "Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of \u03b2 carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.",
    "Contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
    "Side Effects": "\u03b2 carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "\u03b2 carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "There are some evidences that \u03b2 carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.",

    "Indications": "Actol is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
    "Pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

    "Indications": "Pioglitazone & Metformin combination is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are already treated with a combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin or whose diabetes is not adequately controlled with Metformin alone or for those patients who have initially responded to Pioglitazone and require additional glycemic control.",
    "Pharmacology": "Pioglitazone depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulindependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is a potent and highly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg). Activation of PPARg nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "General: The use of antihyperglycemic therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Pioglitazone 45 mg and Metformin 2550 mg.Dosage Recommendations: Selecting the starting dose of Pioglitazone & Metformin should be based on the patient's current regimen of Pioglitazone and/or Metformin. Pioglitazone & Metformin should be given in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin.Starting dose for patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy Based on the usual starting dose of Pioglitazone (15-30 mg daily), Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once or twice daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Starting dose for patients who initially responded to Pioglitazone monotherapy and require additional glycemic controlBased on the usual starting doses of Metformin (500 mg twice daily or 850 mg daily), Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.Starting dose for patients switching from combination therapy of Pioglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated with either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strengths based on the dose of Pioglitazone and Metformin already being taken.Maximum Recommended Dose: Pioglitazone & Metformin tablets are available as a 15 mg Pioglitazone plus 500 mg Metformin or a 15 mg Pioglitazone plus 850 mg Metformin formulation for oral administration. The maximum recommended dose for Pioglitazone is 45 mg daily. The maximum recommended daily dose for Metformin is 2550 mg in adults. Special Patient Populations: The initial and maintenance dosing of combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of Metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. Therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of active liver disease or increased serumtransaminase levels (ALT greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at start of therapy. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended in all patients prior to initiation of therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin and periodically thereafter",
    "Interaction": "May impair vit B12 absorption. Increased plasma levels with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil). Decreased plasma levels with CYP2C8 inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Reduced metabolism with cationic drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in patients with:\n\nRenal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g. as suggested by serum creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dl in male, >1.4 mg/dl in females or abnormal creatinine clearance), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction and septicemia.\nKnown hypersensitivity to Pioglitazone, Metformin or any other component of this combination.\nAcute or chronic metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without coma.",
    "Side Effects": "Generally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with this combination or its individual components. So, it should only be used if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Nursing mother: It is not known whether Pioglitazone and/or Metformin are secreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, this combination should not be administered to a breastfeeding woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of insulin. Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases.Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive ActoMeg.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Combination Oral hypoglycemic preparations",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store in a cool and dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of the reach of the children."

    "Indications": "Pioglitazone & Metformin combination is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are already treated with a combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin or whose diabetes is not adequately controlled with Metformin alone or for those patients who have initially responded to Pioglitazone and require additional glycemic control.",
    "Pharmacology": "Pioglitazone depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulindependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is a potent and highly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg). Activation of PPARg nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "General: The use of antihyperglycemic therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Pioglitazone 45 mg and Metformin 2550 mg.Dosage Recommendations: Selecting the starting dose of Pioglitazone & Metformin should be based on the patient's current regimen of Pioglitazone and/or Metformin. Pioglitazone & Metformin should be given in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin.Starting dose for patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy Based on the usual starting dose of Pioglitazone (15-30 mg daily), Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once or twice daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Starting dose for patients who initially responded to Pioglitazone monotherapy and require additional glycemic controlBased on the usual starting doses of Metformin (500 mg twice daily or 850 mg daily), Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.Starting dose for patients switching from combination therapy of Pioglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated with either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strengths based on the dose of Pioglitazone and Metformin already being taken.Maximum Recommended Dose: Pioglitazone & Metformin tablets are available as a 15 mg Pioglitazone plus 500 mg Metformin or a 15 mg Pioglitazone plus 850 mg Metformin formulation for oral administration. The maximum recommended dose for Pioglitazone is 45 mg daily. The maximum recommended daily dose for Metformin is 2550 mg in adults. Special Patient Populations: The initial and maintenance dosing of combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of Metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. Therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of active liver disease or increased serumtransaminase levels (ALT greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at start of therapy.

Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area.Symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity may include generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal upset and angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and reduction in blood pressure. Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life threatening. Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These symptoms are usually of transitory nature.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no restrictions on the treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy as insulin does not pass the placental barrier. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero.
