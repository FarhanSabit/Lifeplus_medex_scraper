    "name": "Salbutamol + Ipratropium (Inhaler)",
    "generic_id": "1784",
    "Indications": "This combination inhalation aerosol is indicated for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on a regular aerosol bronchodilator who continues to have evidence of bronchospasm and who requires a second bronchodilator.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "This inhalation aerosol is a combination of Salbutamol (as Sulphate) and Ipratropium Bromide. It is a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) based environment friendly inhaler. Because it does not contain chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) as propellant which is one of the main reasons of ozone layer depletion.Salbutamol is a short acting beta2-adrenergic bronchodilator and Ipratropium Bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator. When used in combination, Ipratropium Bromide prevents the increase in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which are caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle. This inhalation aerosol\u00a0is expected to maximize the response of the treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms, anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) and sympathomimetic. Simultaneous administration of an anticholinergic (Ipratropium Bromide) and a beta 2-sympathomimetic (Salbutamol) is designed to benefit the patient by producing a greater bronchodilatory effect than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "This inhalation aerosol has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines and steroids, commonly used in the treatment of COPD. No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with this inhalation aerosol and these or other medications commonly used in the treatment of COPD. Ipratropium Bromide should be co-administered cautiously with other anticholinergic agents and sympathomimetic agents, which may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. Beta-2-agonist containing drugs, like this inhalation aerosol, should be administrated with extreme caution in patients with non-potassium sparing diuretics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.",
    "Contraindications": "This inhalation aerosol is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to Soya-Lecithin or related food products such as soybean and peanut. This inhalation aerosol is also contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to any other components of the drug product or to atropine or its derivatives.",
    "Side Effects": "Due to presence of Salbutamol, mild tremor and headache have been reported. These usually disappear with continuous treatment. There have been very rare reports of treatments muscle cramp, hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, urticaria, bronchospasm and hypotension. For the presence of Ipratropium Bromide headache, influenza, chest pain, nausea, dyspnea, coughing, pharyngitis, sinusitis are rarely reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Ipratropium Bromide: Pregnancy category B. Studies have demonstrated no teratogenic effects as a result of ipratropium. Salbutamol: Pregnancy category C. Salbutamol has been shown to be teratogenic in animals.There are, however no adequate and well-controlled studies of Salpium Inhalation Aerosol (Salbutamol and Ipratropium Bromide combination) in pregnant woman. This inhalation aerosol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether the components of the Salpium InhalationAerosol are excreted in human milk. As many drugs are excreted in human milk, Salpium should be cautiously administered to a nursing mother.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/625/salbutamol-ipratropium-solution-for-inhalation": {
    "name": "Salbutamol + Ipratropium (Solution for inhalation)",
    "generic_id": "625",
    "Indications": "Salbutamol sulfate & Ipratropium bromide solution for inhalation is indicated for the treatment of reversible bronchospasm associated with obstructive airway diseases in patients who require more than a single bronchodilator.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Ipratropium Bromide is quickly absorbed after inhalation. The systemic bioavailability following inhalation is estimated to be less than 10% of the dose. Renal excretion of Ipratropium Bromide is given as 46% of the dose after intravenous administration. The half-life of the terminal elimination phase is about 1.6 hours as determined after intravenous administration. Elimination half-life of drug and metabolites is 3.6 hours as determined after radio labelling. Ipratropium Bromide does not penetrate the blood brain barrier.Salbutamoi Sulphate is rapidly and completely absorbed following administration either by inhaled or oral route. Peak plasma Salbutamoi concentrations are seen within three hours of administration and it is excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours. The elimination half-life is 4 hours. Salbutamoi will cross the blood brain barrier reaching concentrations amounting to about five percent of the plasma concentrations.It has been shown that co-nebulisation of Ipratropium Bromide and Salbutamoi Sulphate does not potentiate the systemic absorption of either component and that therefore the additive activity of this solution is due to the combined local effect on the lung following inhalation.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "The concurrent administration of other beta-mimetics, systemically absorbed anticholinergics and xanthine derivatives may increase the side effects.Beta-agonist induced hypokalaemia may be increased by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, glucocorticosteroids and diuretics. This should be taken into account particularly in patients with severe airway obstruction.Hypokalaemia may result in an increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in patients receiving digoxin. It is recommended that serum potassium levels be monitored in such situations.A potentially serious reduction in bronchodilator effect may occur during concurrent administration of beta-blockers.Beta-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of beta adrenergic agonists may be enhanced.Inhalation of halogenated hydrocarbon anaesthetics such as halothane, trichloroethylene and enflurane may increase the susceptibility to the cardiovascular effects of beta-agonists.",
    "Contraindications": "This is contraindicated in patients with hypertrophic obstructive tachyarrhythmia and in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to atropine or its derivatives, or to any other component of the product.",
    "Side Effects": "In common with other beta-agonists containing products, side effects of this solution can include fine tremor of skeletal muscles and nervousness and less frequently tachycardia, dizziness, palpitations or headache, especially in hypersensitive patients.Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from prolonged and/or high dose beta2 agonist therapy.As with use of other inhalation therapy, cough, local irritation and less commonly inhalation induced bronchospasm can occur. As with other beta-mimetics, nausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness and myalgia/muscle cramps may occur. In rare cases decrease in diastolic blood pressure, increase in systolic blood pressure, arrhythmias, particularly after higher doses, may occur.In individual cases psychological alterations have been reported under inhalation therapy with beta-mimetics.The most frequent non-respiratory anticholinergic related adverse events are dryness of mouth and dysphonia. There have been isolated reports of ocular complications (i.e. mydriasis, increased intraocular pressure, angle closure glaucoma, and eye pain) when aerosolised ipratropium bromide either alone or in combination with adrenergic beta2 agonist, has escaped into the eyes. Ocular side effects, gastrointestinal motility disturbances and urinary retention may occur in rare cases and are reversible.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category C. Animal studies with Salbutamoi Sulphate have demonstrated a teratogenic effect. It is not known whether this medication is harmful to the fetus. No evidence of abnormalities has been reported in women receiving albuterol during pregnancy. This solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies. This solution should be used with caution before childbirth in view of Salbutamol's inhibitory effects on uterine contractions.Salbutamol Sulphate and Ipratropium Bromide are probably excreted in breast milk and their effects on neonates are not known. Although lipid-insoluble quaternary bases pass into breast milk, it is unlikely that this will happen to any extent especially when taken by inhalation. However, because many drugs are excreted in breast milk, caution should be exercised when This solution is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "In the case of acute, rapidly worsening dyspnoea a doctor should be consulted immediately. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of this solution as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm and oropharyngeal oedema.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Combined bronchodilators",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Salicylic Acid has a potent keratolytic & a slight antiseptic action when applied topically to the skin. In low concentrations, the drug has keratoplastic activity (correction of abnormal keratinization) & in higher concentrations, the drug has keratolytic activity (causes peeling of skin). Salicylic Acid softens & destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration (water concentration), probably because of decreased pH, which causes the cornified epithelium (horny layer of the skin) to swell, soften, & then desquamate. Necrosis of normal skin has been associated with overuse of the drug. At high concentrations, Salicylic Acid has a caustic effect. Moisture is essential for Salicylic Acid to exert its action on the skin and for maceration and desquamation of epidermal tissue to occur. The drug has weak antifungal & antibacterial activity.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "6% & 12% Salicylic Acid: Apply to affected area once daily. Hydrate area for 5 minutes prior to application if possible. Occlude the area at night. Wash off in morning.

The incubation period varies from a few weeks to several months. Warts can spread by direct contact with a wart to damaged skin.\nCorns: A corn is a small, hardened area of skin which often looks yellow compared to the surrounding skin. It is typically round or cone-shaped, pointing down into the skin. Corns most often form on the feet and sometimes on the hands and are caused by constant or repeated friction or pressure.\nCalluses: A callus is rough, thickened skin spread over a wide area. Like a corn, it is caused by constant or repeated friction or pressure, but unlike corns, calluses are flat and have normal skin markings.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Salicylic acid is a widely used and effective keratolytic, it produces desquamation and destruction of the epithelium by solubilising the intercellular cement of the Stratum Corneum. Lactic acid affects the keratinisation process, reducing hyperkeratosis and is also caustic, leading to the destruction of hyperkeratotic tissue. Collodion is derived from cellulose in a base containing ethanol and ether. It allows easy and accurate application of the product and dries to leave a film which hydrates the tissue and facilitates penetration of the active ingredients.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Unscrew bottle cap and with the help of brush applicator, apply to the affected areas. \u2018Before starting to use this topical solution, unscrew the fitted cap, discard it. Carefully remove the plug away from your body to avoid splashing into eyes/ face and discard it, replace with the brush applicator cap provided inthe sealed polybag given in the carton. This topical solution should be applied to the affected areas once daily, according to the following instructions:\n\nSoak affected site in hot water for five minutes.\nRub surface carefully with pumice stone or emeryboard to remove any hard skin. Dry with your own towel.\nApply this topical solution using the brush applicator supplied, taking care to avoid contact with normal skin.\nAllow to dry thoroughly and cover with plaster if lesion is large or on the foot to help penetration of active ingredients.\nContinue treatment once daily until the lesion is completely cleared and the ridge lines of the skin have been restored or when the corn can be removed.\nThe usual treatment period is 6 to 12 weeks.",
    "Interaction": "This topical solution may increase the absorption of other topically applied medicines. Therefore, concomitant use of this topical solution and other topical medicines on the treated area should be avoided. As systemic exposure of topically applied this topical solution is low, interaction with systemically administered medicines is not anticipated.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Do not use on open wounds, irritated or reddened skin, or any area that is infected. This solution should not be used on the face, anogenital regions, moles, birthmarks, mucous membranes, warts with hair growing from them, red edges or an unusual colour. Avoid applying to normal skin. This solution may cause eye irritation. Avoid contact with eyes and other mucous membranes. In case of accidental contact with the eyes or other mucous membranes, flush with water for 15 minutes. Avoid exposure to healthy skin. This solution may cause skin irritation. If undue skin irritation develops treatment should be discontinued. Consider alternative treatments if warts cover a large area of the body (more than 5 cm2) due to the potential risk of salicylate toxicity. This solution is not recommended in patients with diabetes, circulatory problems or peripheral neuropathy except under the supervision of a doctor. Oral salicylates taken during or immediately after a viral illness have been associated with Reye\u2019s syndrome and hence there is a theoretical risk with topical salicylates. Therefore, use is not advised in children or teenagers during or immediately after chickenpox, influenza, or other viral infections. It has been reported that salicylates are excreted via breastmilk. Patients should be advised not to inhale the vapour. Keep out of the sight and reach of children.",
    "Side Effects": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 and <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 and <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000), including isolated reports.Rash (common), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Application site reaction, pruritus, burning sensation, erythema, scaling, dryness (Very common), Skin hypertrophy (Common).Toxicities: In the event of accidental oral ingestion symptoms of salicylate toxicity may occur. The risk of developing symptoms of salicylate poisoning or salicylism is increased if this solution is used excessively or if it is used for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, duration of use and recommended frequency compliance is very important. Management should be as clinically indicated.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The safety of this solution during human pregnancy has not been established. Studies in animals given salicylic acid orally demonstrated embryo toxicity at high doses. D-film is not recommended during pregnancy. Salicylates are excreted in human milk. This solution is not recommended during lactation. If used or administered during lactation, care should be taken to avoid contact with the breast area in order to avoid accidental ingestion by the infant.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "This preparation is formulated for the controlled corrosion of keratin and thus care should be taken to apply the product to the affected area only. Do not use on the face or anogenital regions or if you are diabetic or have impaired circulation. Do not use on moles, birthmarks or unusual skin growths. Do not treat warts over large areas at one time, or use on infants and very young children unless on medical advice. For External Use Only",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Combined preparations",
    "Storage Conditions": "In view of its high inflammability, it is recommended that Salicylic Acid & Lactic Acid be stored in a cool place not exceeding 25\u00b0C. Keep away from naked flame.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Salmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent \u03b2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "Both non-selective and selective \u03b2-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.",
    "Contraindications": "This is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.",
    "Side Effects": "As this preparation contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Use in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.",

In clinical studies, Saroglitazar tablet has demonstrated reduction of triglycerides (TG), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, non-High Density Lipoprotein (non- HDL) cholesterol and an increase in HDL cholesterol. It has also shown favorable glycemic indices by reducing the fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetic patients.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Saroglitazar is a potent and predominantly Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR)- alpha agonist with moderate PPAR-gamma agonistic activity. PPARs are nuclear lipid-activated transcription factors that regulate the expression of various genes involved in the control of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, glucose homeostasis and inflammatory processes. Saroglitazar showed both anti-dyslipidemic and anti-diabetic effects mainly mediated via activation of PPAR \u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 respectively. PPAR\u03b1 activation by saroglitazar increases the hepatic oxidation of fatty acids (FA) and reduces the synthesis and secretion of TG. This in turn increases diversion of FA from peripheral tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle and fat tissue) to the liver, and thereby decreasing both FA synthesis and delivery of TG to peripheral tissues. Saroglitazar also causes increased lipolysis and elimination of TG-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and reducing production of apolipoprotein C-III (an inhibitor of LPL activity). Consistent with the above mechanism, saroglitazar was also found to reduce plasma LDL cholesterol. PPAR\u03b1 activation by saroglitazar also induces an increase in the synthesis of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II and HDL-cholesterol.Although saroglitazar is predominantly a PPAR\u03b1 agonist, it also causes activation of PPAR\u03b3 and regulates the transcription of insulin-re-sponsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport and utilization. Saroglitazar increases the expression of numerous PPAR\u03b3-responsive genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, including adiponectin, adipocyte fatty-acid binding protein (aP2), LPL, fatty acid transport protein (FATP) and fatty acid translocase (CD36). By increasing the expression of these genes, saroglitazar decreases the post prandial rise of plasma free fatty acids, improves post-absorptive insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output, reduces the metabolic burden on liver & muscle and promotes glucose utilization. Robust antidiabetic and insulin sensitizing effects of saroglitazar were observed in preclinical models.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of Saroglitazar is two tablets of 2 mg once a day.Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Saroglitazar in children less than 18 years of age have not been established.Geriatric Use: Considering the comorbidity and concomitant medications in elderly patients, Saroglitazar should be used with caution in geriatric patients.",
    "Interaction": "In vitro studies using recombinant human cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isozymes indicate that Saroglitazar does not significantly inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 at concentrations of 10pM. Similarly, Saroglitazar did not show any potential for CYP3A4 enzyme induction when tested up to 100 pM concentration in a luciferase-based reporter assay in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. Although no clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with Saroglitazar so far, because the tested concentrations (10 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM) are several times higher than the mean C max of Saroglitazar, it can be inferred that Saroglitazar would not cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions related to the above-evaluated CYPs.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to Saroglitazar or any of the excipients used in the formulation.",
    "Side Effects": "In two controlled phase III clinical studies of 12 to 24 weeks treatment duration with Saroglitazar, the most common adverse events (AEs > 2%) reported were gastritis, asthenia and pyrexia. Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in nature and did not result in discontinuation of the study. Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, AE rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. The safety of Saroglitazar in pregnant women has not been established as there is no adequate and well-controlled study carried out in pregnant women. Women who become pregnant during Saroglitazar treatment should contact their physicians. Saroglitazar should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Nursing Mothers: Nursing mothers should not use Saroglitazar because it is not known whether Saroglitazar is excreted into breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Saroglitazar treatment should be initiated with caution in patients with abnormal liver or renal function, or history of myopathies. Saroglitazar should be initiated with caution in patients with type 2 diabetes having cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure and such patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Patients who experience rapid increase in weight should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure.",

IL-17 represents is a six-membered family (IL-17A to F) of pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokines, expression of which is found to be elevated in psoriatic skin. These cytokines act on many different cell types and provide defense against different extracellular pathogens causing fungal or bacterial infections. IL-17 cytokines are produced by many cells involved in immune system defense, such as Th17, mast cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells - all implicated in promoting inflammation.

    "Pharmacology": "Selpercatinib is a kinase inhibitor. Selpercatinib inhibited wild-type RET and multiple mutated RET isoforms as well as VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 with IC50 values ranging from 0.92 nM to 67.8 nM. In other enzyme assays, Selpercatinib also inhibited FGFR 1, 2, and 3 at higher concentrations that were still clinically achievable. In cellular assays, Selpercatinib inhibited RET at approximately 60-fold lower concentrations than FGFR1 and 2 and approximately 8-fold lower concentration than VEGFR3.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dosage of Selpercatinib based on body weight is:\n\nLess than 50 kg: 120 mg\n50 kg or greater: 160 mg\n\r\nTake Selpercatinib orally twice daily (approximately every 12 hours) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Swallow the capsules whole. Do not crush or chew the capsules. Do not take a missed dose unless it is more than 6 hours until next scheduled dose. If vomiting occurs after Selpercatinib administration, do not take an additional dose and continue to the next scheduled time for the next dose.Dosage Modifications for Concomitant Use of Acid-Reducing Agents Avoid concomitant use of a PPI, a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist, or a locally-acting antacid with Selpercatinib. If concomitant use cannot be avoided:\n\nTake Selpercatinib with food when co-administered with a PPI.\nTake Selpercatinib 2 hours before or 10 hours after administration of an H2 receptor antagonist.\nTake Selpercatinib 2 hours before or 2 hours after administration of a locally-acting antacid.",
    "Interaction": "Acid-Reducing Agents: Concomitant use of Selpercatinib with acid-reducing agents decreases Selpercatinib plasma concentrations, which may reduce Selpercatinib anti-tumor activity. Avoid concomitant use of PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and locally-acting antacids with Selpercatinib. If co-administration cannot be avoided, take Selpercatinib with food (with a PPI) or modify its administration time (with a H2 receptor antagonist or a locally-acting antacid).Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Concomitant use of Selpercatinib with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases Selpercatinib plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of Selpercatinib adverse reactions, including QTc interval prolongation. Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors with Selpercatinib. If concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the Selpercatinib dosage and monitor the QT interval with ECGs more frequently.Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Concomitant use of Selpercatinib with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases Selpercatinib plasma concentrations, which may reduce Selpercatinib anti-tumor activity. Avoid co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers with Selpercatinib.",
    "Contraindications": "Not available",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects of Selpercatinib are:\n\nhigher levels of liver enzymes\nhigher blood sugar levels\nlower white blood cell count\nlower protein (albumin) levels in the blood\nlower calcium levels in the blood\ndry mouth\ndiarrhea\nhigher creatinine levels (this measures kidney function)\nhigh blood pressure\ntiredness\nswelling of your arms, legs, hands, and feet (peripheral edema)\nlower platelet count\nhigher cholesterol levels\nrash\nlower salt (sodium) levels in the blood\n\r\nconstipation",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Based on findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action, SELPERCATINIB can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on SELPERCATINIB use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risk. Administration of Selpercatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryolethality and malformations at maternal exposures that were approximately equal to the human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Lactation: There are no data on the presence of Selpercatinib or its metabolites in human milk or on their effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with SELPERCATINIB and for 1 week after the final dose.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hepatotoxicity: Serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with Selpercatinib. Monitor ALT and AST prior to initiating Selpercatinib, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue Selpercatinib based on the severity.Hypertension: Hypertension occurred in 35% of patients, including Grade 3 hypertension in 17% and Grade 4 in one (0.1%) patient. Overall, 4.6% had their dose interrupted and 1.3% had their dose reduced for hypertension. Treatment-emergent hypertension was most commonly managed with anti-hypertension medications. Do not initiate Selpercatinib in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating Selpercatinib. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, at least monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue Selpercatinib based on the severity.QT Interval Prolongation: Selpercatinib can cause concentration-dependent QT interval prolongation. An increase in QTcF interval to >500 ms was measured in 6% of patients and an increase in the QTcF interval of at least 60 ms over baseline was measured in 15% of patients. Selpercatinib has not been studied in patients with clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or recent myocardial infarction. Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, and severe or uncontrolled heart failure. Assess QT interval, electrolytes and TSH at baseline and periodically during treatment, adjusting frequency based upon risk factors including diarrhea. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Selpercatinib and during treatment. Monitor the QT interval more frequently when Selpercatinib is concomitantly administered with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors or drugs known to prolong QTc interval. Withhold and dose reduce or permanently discontinue Selpercatinib based on the severity.Hemorrhagic Events: Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with Selpercatinib. Grade >3 hemorrhagic events occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Selpercatinib, including 3 (0.4%) patients with fatal hemorrhagic events, including one case each of cerebral hemorrhage, tracheostomy site hemorrhage, and hemoptysis. Permanently discontinue Selpercatinib in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage.Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity occurred in 4.3% of patients receiving Selpercatinib, including Grade 3 hypersensitivity in 1.6%. The median time to onset was 1.7 weeks (range: 6 days to 1.5 years). Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity included fever, rash and arthralgias or myalgias with concurrent decreased platelets or transaminitis. If hypersensitivity occurs, withhold Selpercatinib and begin corticosteroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent). Upon resolution of the event, resume Selpercatinib at a reduced dose and increase the dose of Selpercatinib by 1 dose level each week as tolerated until reaching the dose taken prior to onset of hypersensitivity. Continue steroids until patient reaches target dose and then taper. Permanently discontinue Selpercatinib for recurrent hypersensitivity.Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred in 1% of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma receiving Selpercatinib. Patients may be at risk of TLS if they have rapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis including hydration, and treat as clinically indicated.",

    "Pharmacology": "Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence as same as to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor. Semaglutide reduces blood glucose in a glucose dependent manner by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion when blood glucose is high. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying. During hypoglycemia, Semaglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. Semaglutide reduces body weight and body fat mass by an overall reduced appetite.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: The extent of exposure in pregnancy during clinical trials was very limited and there are no adequate and well controlled studies of Semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, Semaxen should not be used during pregnancy. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, Semaxen should be discontinued. Semaxen should be discontinued at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long half-life of Semaglutide.Lactation: There are no data on the presence of Semaglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the unknown potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant due to the possible accumulation of salcaprozate sodium (SNAC), an absorption enhancer in Semaxen, from breastfeeding and because there are alternative formulations of Semaglutide that can be used during lactation, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Semaxen. Discontinue Semaxen in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout period for Semaglutide.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycemia while driving and using machines. Semaglutide causes an increase in heart rate. Caution should be observed in patients who have cardiac conditions that might be worsened by an increase in heart rate, such as tachyarrhythmias. Patients treated with Semaglutide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by reducing the dose of the secretagogue or insulin when initiating treatment with Semaxen.",

Closer monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving Sevelamer Carbonate and levothyroxine. Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medicinal products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials. Caution should be exercised when prescribing Sevelamer Carbonate to patients also taking these medicinal products. In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, Sevelamer Hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as Sevelamer Carbonate, had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. Sevelamer Carbonate is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after Sevelamer Carbonate, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels.",

    "name": "Sevoflurane",
    "generic_id": "983",
    "Indications": "Sevoflurane is indicated for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in adult and pediatric patients for inpatient and outpatient surgery. Each ml inhalation liquid contains Sevoflurane USP 100% V/V.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Sevoflurane is a preparation of Sevoflurane, a volatile liquid for inhalation. Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic agent for use in induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of Sevoflurane decreases with age. Sevoflurane is weakly soluble in blood and tissue, resulting in the rapid achievement of a sufficient alveolar concentration to produce anesthesia and a subsequent rapid elimination until cessation of anesthesia. Sevoflurane produces loss of consciousness, reversible abolition of pain and motor activity, diminution of autonomic reflexes, respiratory and cardiovascular depression. These effects are dose-dependent. Sevoflurane has a low blood/gas partition coefficient (0.65) leading to a rapid recovery from anesthesia.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Route of administration: It should be administered by inhalation delivered from a vaporizer. The concentration of Sevoflurane being delivered from a vaporizer should be known. This may be accomplished by using a vaporizer calibrated specifically for Sevoflurane. Sevoflurane should be administered only by persons trained in the administration of general anesthesia. Facilities for maintenance of a patent airway, artificial ventilation, oxygen enrichment and circulatory resuscitation must be immediately available. Since level of anesthesia may be altered rapidly, only vaporizers producing predictable concentrations of Sevoflurane should be used. The administration of general anesthesia must be individualized based on the patient's response.Pre-anesthetic medication: No specific premedication is either indicated or contraindicated with Sevoflurane. The decision as to whether or not to premedicate and the choice of premedication is left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist.Induction: Sevoflurane has a nonpungent odor and does not cause respiratory irritability; it is suitable for mask induction in pediatrics and adults.Maintenance: Surgical levels of anesthesia can usually be achieved with concentrations of 0.5-3% Sevoflurane with or without the concomitant use of nitrous oxide. Sevoflurane can be administered with any type of anesthesia circuit.Use in children and adolescents: The safety and efficacy of induction and maintenance of general anesthesia with sevoflurane have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 to 18 years",
    "Interaction": "Epinephrine administered with sevoflurane may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Sevoflurane may lead to marked hypotension in patients treated with calcium antagonists. Impairment of atrioventricular conduction may be observed when verapamil and sevoflurane are administered concomitantly. Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors and inhalational anesthetics may increase the risk of hemodynamic instability during surgery or medical procedures. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with barbiturates, propofol and other commonly used intravenous anesthetics. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with benzodiazepines and opioids as commonly used in surgical practice. The anesthetic requirement for sevoflurane is decreased when administered in combination with nitrous oxide. The risk of developing malignant hyperthermia increases with the concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents. Sevoflurane increases both the intensity and duration of neuromuscular blockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation. Among available nondepolarizing agents, only vecuronium, pancuronium and atracurium interactions have been studied during sevoflurane anesthesia. Cases of mild, moderate and severe hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis after anesthesia with sevoflurane have been reported. An exothermic reaction occurs when sevoflurane is exposed to CO2 absorbents. KOFI containing CO2 absorbents are not recommended for use with sevoflurane.",
    "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to sevoflurane or other halogenated inhalational anesthetics or any other components of this product. It is also contraindicated in patients with known or suspected genetic susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects are bradycardia, hypotension, agitation, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, breathholding, cough increased, tachycardia, shivering, somnolence, increased salivation, nausea and vomiting.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The safety of sevoflurane in labor and delivery has not been demonstrated. Sevoflurane can cause uterine smooth muscle relaxation and may contribute to uterine atony.Lactation: It is not known whether sevoflurane or its metabolites are present in human milk. To minimize infant exposure to sevoflurane or its metabolites, a nursing mother may temporarily pump and discard breast milk produced during the first 24 hours after administration of sevoflurane. Exercise caution when administering sevoflurane to a nursing mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Because clinical experience in administering sevoflurane to patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine >1.5 mg/dl) is limited, its safety in these patients has not been established. Sevoflurane may be associated with glycosuria and proteinuria when used for long procedures at low flow rates. Sevoflurane may present an increased risk in patients with known sensitivity to volatile halogenated anesthetic agents. Sevoflurane may cause respiratory depression, which may be augmented by opioid premedication or other agents causing respiratory depression. Reports of QT prolongation have been received. Fatal outcomes of malignant hyperthermia have been reported. Use of inhaled anesthetic agents has been associated with rare increases in serum potassium levels that have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias and death in pediatric patients during the postoperative period. Episodes of severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest, not related to underlying congenital heart disease, have been reported during anesthesia induction with sevoflurane in pediatric patients with Down syndrome. During induction, closely monitor heart rate and consider incrementally increasing the inspired sevoflurane concentration until a suitable level of anesthesia is achieved. Consider having an anticholinergic and epinephrine available when administering sevoflurane for induction in this patient population. During the maintenance of anesthesia, increasing the concentration of sevoflurane produces dose dependent decreases in blood pressure. Excessive decreases in blood pressure or respiratory depression may be related to depth of anesthesia and may be corrected by decreasing the inspired concentration of sevoflurane. The recovery from general anesthesia should be assessed carefully before a patient is discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/984/sildenafil-citrate": {
    "name": "Sildenafil Citrate",
    "generic_id": "984",
    "Indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Sildenafil Citrate to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Sildenafil is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.Absorption and Distribution: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.Metabolism and Excretion: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Erectile dysfunction: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
    "Interaction": "Sildenafil metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Sildenafil clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Sildenafil clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Sildenafil concentrations when coadministered with Sildenafil (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Sildenafil was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Sildenafil systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Sildenafil Cmax and a 210% increase in Sildenafil AUC. Sildenafil had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Sildenafil clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Sildenafil Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Sildenafil was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Sildenafil had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Sildenafil has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Sildenafil levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Sildenafil at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Sildenafil AUC and a 55% decrease in Sildenafil Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Sildenafil. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Sildenafil. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Sildenafil pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Sildenafil, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.",
    "Contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",
    "Side Effects": "Body as a whole: face edema, photosensitivity reaction, shock, asthenia, pain, chills, accidental fall, abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chest pain, accidental injury.Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, AV block, migraine, syncope, tachycardia, palpitation,hypotension, postural hypotension, myocardial ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, cardiac arrest, heart failure, abnormal electrocardiogram, cardiomyopathy.Digestive: vomiting, glossitis, colitis, dysphagia, gastritis, gastroenteritis, esophagitis, stomatitis, dry mouth, liver function tests abnormal, rectal hemorrhage, gingivitis.Hemic and Lymphatic: anemia and leukopenia.Metabolic and Nutritional: thirst, edema, gout, unstable diabetes, hyperglycemia, peripheral edema, hyperuricemia, hypoglycemic reaction, hypernatremia.Musculoskeletal: arthritis, arthrosis, myalgia, tendon rupture, tenosynovitis, bone pain,myasthenia, synovitis.Nervous: ataxia, hypertonia, neuralgia, neuropathy, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo, depression, insomnia, somnolence, abnormal dreams, reflexes decreased, hyperesthesia.Respiratory: asthma, dyspnea, laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, sputum increased, cough increased.Skin and Appendages: urticaria, herpes simplex, pruritus, sweating, skin ulcer, contact dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis.Special Senses: sudden decrease or loss of hearing, mydriasis, conjunctivitis, photophobia, tinnitus, eye pain, ear pain, eye hemorrhage, cataract, dry eyes.Urogenital: cystitis, nocturia, urinary frequency, breast enlargement, urinary incontinence, abnormal ejaculation, genital edema and anorgasmia.Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular: Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of Sildenafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Sildenafil and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.Nervous: seizure, seizure recurrence, anxiety, and transient global amnesia.Urogenital: prolonged erection, priapism and hematuria.Special Senses: diplopia, temporary vision loss/decreased vision, ocular redness or bloodshot appearance, ocular burning, ocular swelling/pressure, increased intraocular pressure, retinal vascular disease or bleeding, vitreous detachment/traction, paramacular edema and epistaxis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sildenafil in pregnant women. Sildenafil is not indicated for use by women. In animal study shows that Sildenafil has no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.Before prescribing Sildenafil, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Sildenafil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).Consideration should be given to the following:\n\nPatients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.\nIn those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose.\nIn those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.\nSafety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.\nSildenafil has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications.\nPatients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Sildenafil. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Sildenafil, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted.\nThe safety of Sildenafil is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.\nSildenafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).\nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of Sildenafil with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.\n\r\nThere is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Sildenafil, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Sildenafil has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Sildenafil - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Sildenafil in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.\n\nPatients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;\nPatients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110);\nPatients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;\nPatients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases);\nPatients with sickle cell or related anemias.\n\r\nProlonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Sildenafil. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Sildenafil is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Sildenafil are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Sildenafil exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Sildenafil (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Sildenafil dosage is recommended.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The mechanism of Silver Sulfadiazine's antibacterial action has not been fully elucidated. After exposure to the drug, structural changes in the bacterial cell membrane occur, including distortion and enlargement of the cell and a weakening of the cell wall membrane. This is accompanied by reduced viability in sensitive strains. The silver sulfadiazine molecule dissociates and the silver moiety is bound to the bacterial cells. It is believed that, after penetrating the cell wall, the silver moiety is attached to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and prevents bacterial cell proliferation. There is approximately 100 times more DNA in mammalian cells than in bacterial cells. It is thought that the ratio of silver sulfadiazine to bacterial DNA is sufficiently high to prevent bacterial division but the corresponding ratio to epithelial DNA is low enough not to block epithelial cell regeneration. The sulfadiazine moiety also provides a bacteriostatic action against sensitive organisms. In adults, up to 10% of the sulfadiazine may be absorbed and 60 to 85% of the absorbed amount is excreted in the urine. In children with 13% body surface area burns, the urinary sulfadiazine concentration was 31.8 mg/L.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The burn wounds are cleansed, and Silver Sulfadiazine is applied over the burn wound. The burn areas should be covered with Silver Sulfadiazine at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately 1/16 inches or 1.5 mm. Whenever necessary; the cream should be reapplied to any areas from which it has been removed by patient activity. If individual patient requirements make dressings necessary, they may be used. Reapplication should be ensured immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with Silver Sulfadiazine should be continued until satisfactory healing is occurred, or until the burn site is ready for grafting. The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except if a significant adverse reaction occurs.",
    "Interaction": "Enzymatic debriding agents: Silver sulfadiazine may inactivate enzymatic debriding agents, thus the concomitant use of these compounds may be inappropriate. Oral hypoglycemic agents and phenytoin: In patients with large area burns where serum sulfadiazine levels may approach therapeutic levels, the action of oral hypoglycemic agents and phenytoin may be potentiated and it is recommended that blood levels be monitored. Cimetidine: In-patients with large area burns, it has been reported that co-administration of Cimetidine may increase the incidence of leukopenia.",
    "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in-patients who are hypersensitive to it or any of the other ingredients in the preparation. It should not be used on pregnant women approaching or at term, on premature infants, or on newborn infants during the first 2 months of life",
    "Side Effects": "Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in-patients receiving Silver Sulfadiazine therapy. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiform, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial nephritis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women approaching or at term. It is not known whether Silver Sulfadiazine is excreted in human milk. A decision should be made, whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: If hepatic and renal functions become impaired and elimination of drug decreases, accumulation may occur and discontinuation of this should be weighed against the therapeutic benefit being achieved. In considering the use of topical proteolytic enzymes in conjunction with it, the possibility should be noted that silver might inactivate such enzymes. Laboratory Tests: In the treatment of burn wounds involving extensive areas of the body, the serum sulfa concentrations may approach adult therapeutic levels (8 mg% to 12 mg%). Therefore, in these patients it would be advisable to monitor serum sulfa concentrations. Renal function should be carefully monitored and the urine should be checked for sulfa crystals.",

Read moreFlatulence, abdominal distention, fullness, gas and windy colic: Simethicone is an excellent and effective antiflatulent. It is used for relief of the painful symptoms of excess gas in the digestive tract. Such gas is frequently caused by excessive swallowing of air or by eating foods that disagree. Simethicone drop is especially used in infants, acts in the stomach and intestines. Thus Simethicone enables freeing and eliminating the gas more easily by belching or passing flatus. Large bowel preparation: Addition of Simethicone to a polyethylene glycol bowel preparation produces symptomatic improvement prior to investigation in the management of accidental ingestion of foaming detergents. Treatment of poisoning: Simethicone has an anecdotal use as an antifoaming agent in the management of accidental ingestion of foaming detergents.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Simethicone is used as an antiflatulent to relieve symptoms commonly referred to gas including upper GI bloating, pressure, fullness or stuffed feeling. The clinical use of Simeticone is based on its antifoaming properties. Its antifoaming action relieves flatulence by dispersing and preventing the formation of mucous surrounded\u00a0gas pockets in the GI tract. Simeticone acts in the stomach and intestines to change the surface tension of gas bubbles, enabling them to coalesce; thus gas is freed and eliminated more easily by belching or passing flatus. Simeticone aids in the elimination of gas from the GI tract and can be used to reduce postoperative gas pains. Simeticone can also be used prior to gastroscopy to enhance visualization and prior to radiography of the intestine to reduce gas shadows.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Simvastatin\u00a0is a preparation of Simvastatin which acts as a Cholesterol lowering agent. The main mechanism of reduction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is that following inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity, the LDL receptor density on the liver cells is increased and this leads to an increased removal of LDL cholesterol from the plasma and increased catabolism of LDL cholesterol. In addition, there is a reduction in the very low- density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and reduced formation of LDL from VLDL. Simvastatin is extensively metabolised in the liver; which is also the main site of action of the drug.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol lowering diet before receiving Simvastatin and should continue on this during treatment with Simvastatin. The usual starting dose is 10 mg/day given as a single dose in the evening. Adjustment of dosage, if required, should be made at intervals of not less than four weeks, to a maximum of 40 mg daily given as a single dose in the evening. If LDL-cholesterol levels fall below 2 mmol/L or total plasma cholesterol levels fall below 3.5 mmol/L consideration should be given to reducing the dose of Simvastatin. In hypercholesterolemia, the recommended starting dose is 5-10 mg once a day in the evening and the recommended dosing range is 5-40 mg per day as a single dose in the evening. In patients with coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia, the starting dose should be 20 mg once a day in the evening. Because Simvastatin does not undergo significant renal excretion, modification of dosage should not be necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. Safety and effectiveness in children and adolescents have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Simvastatin and Digoxin in normal volunteers resulted in a slight elevation (less than 0.3 \u00b5gm/ml) in drug concentrations in plasma compared to concomitant administration of placebo and Digoxin. Coumarin derivatives: Slightly enhance the anticoagulant effect of Warfarin (mean changes in p rothrombin time less than two seconds) in normal volunteers maintained in a state of low therapeutic anticoagulation. Others: In clinical studies, Simvastatin was used concomitantly with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and NSAIDs without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.",

It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using Sitagliptin.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by Sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of sitagliptin is 50 mg twice a day and 100 mg once daily. Sitagliptin can be taken with or without food.",
    "Interaction": "Effects of sitagliptin on other Drugs: Sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptive.Digoxin: Sitagliptin slightly increases the mean of Digoxin concentration. However, no dose adjustment of either drug is required.",
    "Contraindications": "History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to sitagliptin, such as anaphylaxis or angioedema.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. It is not known whether sitagliptin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sitagliptin is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "If pancreatitis is suspected, sitagliptin should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.Use in Patients with Renal Insufficiency: Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.Use with medications known to cause Hypoglycemia: When sitagliptin is used in combination therapy dosage adjustment of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin.

    "Pharmacology": "This tablet combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal.

By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",

This tablet should be given twice daily with meals.The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side efects associated with metformin.The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of this tablet is 50 mg sitagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily.No studies have been performed specifcally examining the safety and efcacy of Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate INN/Metformin Hydrochloride BP in patients previously treated with other oral antihyperglycemic agents and switched to Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate INN/Metformin Hydrochloride BP. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur.Dose of extended-release tablet: Administer once daily with a meal preferably in the evening. Gradually escalate the dose to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to Metformin. May adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg Sitagliptin and 2000 mg Metformin extended-release. Maintain the same total daily dose of Sitagliptin and Metformin when changing between film-coated tablet and extended-release tablet, without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 2000 mg Metformin extended-release.Patients using two extended-release tablets (such as two 50/500 or two 50/1000 tablets) should take the two tablets together once daily. The 100 mg Sitagliptin/1000 mg Metformin HCI extended-release tablet should be taken as a single tablet once daily. Patients treated with an insulin secretagogue or insulin: Co-administration of the combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.",
    "Interaction": "Cationic Drugs: Cationic drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion: Use with caution.Phenprocoumon: Metformin may decrease the anticoagulant effect of phenprocoumon. Therefore, close monitoring of the INR is recommended.Levothyroxine: Levothyroxine can reduce the hypoglycemic effect of metformin.

    "Composition": "Each vial contains lyophilized preparation of Snake Venom Antiserum. After reconstitution each ml Snake Venom Antiserum neutralizes not less than Cobra venom (Naja naja) 0.60 mg, Common Krait venom (Bungarus caeruleus) 0.45 mg, Russell's Viper venom (Vipera russelli) 0.60 mg, Saw scaled Viper venom (Echis carinatus) 0.45 mg.",
    "Pharmacology": "Snake venom antiserum is a sterile preparation containing antitoxin globulins and their derivatives. It is the only specific treatment for venomous snake bites.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "As of now Snake venom antiserum is the only specific antidote for snake envenomation and prompt administration of adequate dose of Antiserum is of paramount importance for neutralization of unbound circulating snake venom components for early response to treatment. Any delay in administration may result in increased dose requirement and decreased effectiveness. As the clinical signs can vary due to many factors such as type of snake, time of reporting after bite, size of snake, amount of venom injected during bite, seasonal & regional variation in venom composition etc., no accurate dosage can be recommended. However, considering the average quantity of venom injected by snake at the time of bite and degree of envenomation, it is recommended to administer initial dose of 5-10 vials of Snake venom antiserum by slow intravenous infusion either undiluted at a speed of not more than 2 ml per minute or after dilution with Normal /glucose saline at a rate of 5-10 ml/kg body weight over one hour. Children should receive the same dose as adults. Constant monitoring of the vital signs at frequent intervals during initial 1 hour is recommended. Requirement of further dosing depends on extent of\u00a0reversal of coagulopathy confirmed after 6 hours of Antiserum administration by WBCT in haemotoxic bite or if symptoms persist or worsen or in respiratory failure in neurotoxic bite after 1 hour of Antiserum administration. If the blood is still in coagulable or no signs of reversal of paralysis are seen, a further dose of 5 to 10 vials of Antiserum should be administered by slow IV route only. Administration by IM or locally around the bite wound is not recommended. In the majority of cases of both neurotoxic and haemotoxic bites, total dose of 15-20 vials is adequate unless a proven recurrence of envenomation is established. In such a scenario, further doses can be given as per clinical condition of the patient. Hypersensitivity skin test has no predictability value and hence should not be used.",
    "Interaction": "Risk of increased severity of acute anaphylaxis when used with \u03b2-adrenergic blockers.",
    "Contraindications": "There are no known contraindications for the administration of Antivenom.",
    "Side Effects": "Snake venom antiserum being derived from equines is heterologous to human can give either early or late reaction. Adrenaline should be always kept handy, before starting the dose of Snake venom antiserum.\u00a0Reduction in adverse reactions has been reported by use of adequate dilution of Snake venom antiserum with saline and controlling rate of infusion.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Considering the risk associated with snake bite envenomation, pregnancy is not a contraindication for the administration of Snake Venom Antiserum subsequent to bite.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Proper precautions are necessary while dealing with persons with a known hypersensitivity to constituents of product. Few doctors prefer to premedicate patients with Inj. Adrenaline 0.25 ml to prevent possibility of adverse reactions. In haemotoxic bites, IM injections should be avoided till the correction of coagulopathy to avoid formation of haematoma and oozing of blood.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Ear wax which often obstructs the external auditory meatus of the ear contains less than 50% of fatty matter derived from secretions of the sebaceous ceruminous glands. The majority of the wax consists of desquamated epithelium, foreign matter and shed hairs. This non-fatty material forms a matrix holding together the granules of fatty matter to form the ceruminous mass. The addition of oils or solvents binds the mass more firmly together, but aqueous solutions, if they are able to penetrate the matrix, cause a disintegration of the ceruminous mass. Sodium bicarbonate ear drops actively dissolves the wax rapidly by penetrating the dry matrix of the ceruminous mass, reducing the solid ear wax to a Semi-Solid debris. It is a quicker, more effective method for wax removal.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Step-1: Tilt the head and gently squeeze 3 to 4 drops into the affected ear without touching the ear with the end of the dropper.Step-2: Keep head tilted, allow the solution to remain in ear for 5-10 minutes, wipe any surplus with a tissue.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Sodium Cromoglycate 2% sterile Eye Drops inhibits the release of chemical mediators from sensitised mast cells and is capable of rapid phosphorylation of mast cell protein. The exact mechanism of action of the drug remains to be elucidated but Sodium Cromoglycate appears to modulate the allergic response to antigen antibody interactions in a way which prevents the subsequent formation or release of toxic or inflammatory mediators. Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops appears to act mainly through a local effect on the mucous of the eye. Approximately 0.03% of an ophthalmic dose of Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops is absorbed systemically. Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops prevent, release of mediators of type-I allergic reactions, including histamine and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) from sensitised mast cells after the antigen antibody union has taken place. The drug does not inhibit the binding of IgE to mast cells nor the interaction between cell bound IgE and the specific antigen; instead Sodium Cromoglycate suppresses the release of substances (e.g. histamine, SRS-A) in response to this reaction. The drug also inhibits Type-III (late allergic, Arthus) reactions.",

Read moreHYLO DUAL eye drop moisturizes cornea and conjunctiva and protects against excessive evaporation of tears. This stabilization of tears relieves the inflammatory symptoms of irritated eyes. In addition, it also relieves the itching and burning sensations associated with allergy.HYLO DUAL is indicated for the treatment of dry eye disease.Burning, itching, tearing, foreign body sensation or the sensation of dry eyes are symptoms of an irritated eye. Quite often this is a result of insufficient lubrication of the surface of the eye. Other symptoms can be triggered by hypersensitivities against certain substances (e.g. pollen, animal hair or house dust), so called allergies. As an allergy shows similar symptoms it is difficult to differentiate between a dry or an allergic eye.In these cases, HYLO DUAL the dual mode of action of sodium hyaluronate and ectoine in HYLO DUAL helps relieve these symptoms.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "HYLO DUAL contains sodium hyaluronate, a physiologic substance which is found in the eye but also in other tissues of the body. Sodium hyaluronate provides an even, stable, especially long lasting lubrication to the surface of the eye without being rinsed away quickly. Ectoine is a natural substance gained from microorganisms that live in an extreme environment (e. g. salt lakes). To be protected against these extreme environmental conditions these microorganisms form the natural substance ectoine. Its specific properties are used in HYLO DUAL. Ectoine increases the binding of water at the cells of the ocular surface. This forms a physiologic barrier on the conjunctiva against allergenic acting substances. Ectoine stabilizes the lipid layer of the tear film that protects against excessive evaporation of tears. The interaction of sodium hyaluronate and ectoine provides intensive long lasting lubrication of the ocular surface and protects against evaporation of tears. The typical symptoms of itching and burning that occur as inflammatory reactions to environmentally triggered irritations as well as to allergic reactions are relieved by HYLO DUAL.",

    "name": "Sofosbuvir + Velpatasvir",
    "generic_id": "1006",
    "Indications": "This is a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor and velpatasvir, an HCV NS5A inhibitor and is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection:\n\nwithout cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis\nwith decompensated cirrhosis for use in combination with ribavirin",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action: Sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is required for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), which can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. In a biochemical assay, GS-461203 inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV genotype 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a with an IC50 value ranging from 0.36 to 3.3 micromolar. GS-461203 is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein, which is required for viral replication. Resistance selection in cell culture and cross-resistance studies indicate Velpatasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action.Pharmacodynamics: Cardiac Electrophysiology: The effect of Sofosbuvir 400 mg (recommended dosage) and 1200 mg (three times the recommended dosage) on QTc interval was evaluated in an active-controlled (Moxifloxacin 400 mg) thorough QT trial. At a dose three times the recommended dose, Sofosbuvir does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. The effect of Velpatasvir 500 mg (five times the recommended dosage) was evaluated in an active-controlled (Moxifloxacin 400 mg) thorough QT trial. At a dose five times the recommended dose, Velpatasvir does not prolong QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Testing prior to the initiation of therapy:\u00a0Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) before initiating HCV treatment with Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir.Recommended Treatment Regimen and Duration in Patients 3 Years of Age and Older: Below table shows the recommended treatment regimen and duration based on patient population. For patients with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection, follow the dosage recommendations in table below.

    "Interaction": "Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir: Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 (the predominant circulating metabolite of Sofosbuvir) is not. In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of Velpatasvir by CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 was observed. Drugs that are inducers of P-gp and/or moderate to potent inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin, St. John\u2019s wort, Carbamazepine) may decrease plasma concentrations of Sofosbuvir and/or Velpatasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir. The use of these agents with Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir is not recommended. Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir may be coadministered with P-gp, BCRP and CYP inhibitors.Potential for Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir to Affect Other Drugs: Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporters P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1. Coadministration of Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir with drugs that are substrates of these transporters may increase the exposure of such drugs.Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Table below provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir, the components of Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir as individual agents or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir.",

Refer to ribavirin prescribing information for additional information.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation in Patients Coinfected with HCV and HBV: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressants or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be increased in these patients. HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increases in aminotransferase levels and in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure and death can occur. Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating HCV treatment with Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir. In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir and during post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone: Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Coadministration of amiodarone with Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative viable treatment options and who will be coadministered Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir:\n\nCounsel patients about the risk of symptomatic bradycardia\nCardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. Patients who are taking Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir, need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Due to amiodarone\u2019s long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems.\n\r\nRisks Associated with Ribavirin and Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir Combination Treatment: If Sofosbuvir & Velpatasvir is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin apply to this combination regimen.

    "Indications": "Solifenacin Succinate is indicated for symptomatic treatment of urge incontinence and/or increased urinary frequency and urgency as may occur in patients with overactive bladder syndrome.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. It has the highest affinity for M3, M1, and M2 muscarinic receptors. 80% of the muscarinic receptors in the bladder are M2, while 20% are M3. Solifenacin's antagonism of the M3 receptor prevents contraction of the detrusor muscle, while antagonism of the M2 receptor may prevent contraction of smooth muscle in the bladder.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose for adults and the elderly: Solifenacin Succinate 5 mg once daily. If needed, the dose may be increased to Solifenacin Succinate 10 mg once daily.Use in children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not yet been established. Therefore, Solifenacin Succinate should not be used in children.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant medication with other medicinal products with anticholinergic properties may result in more pronounced therapeutic effects and undesirable effects. An interval of approximately one week should be allowed after stopping treatment with Solifenacin Succinate before commencing other anticholinergic therapy. The therapeutic effect of Solifenacin may be reduced by concomitant administration of cholinergic receptor agonists. Solifenacin can reduce the effect of medicinal products that stimulate the motility of the gastrointestinal tract, such as Metoclopramide and Cisapride. In vitro studies have demonstrated that at therapeutic concentrations, Solifenacin does not inhibit CYP1A1/2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 derived from human liver microsomes. Therefore, Solifenacin is unlikely to alter the clearance of drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes. Solifenacin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Simultaneous administration of Ketoconazole (200 mg/day), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a two-fold increase of the AUC of Solifenacin, while Ketoconazole at a dose of 400 mg/day resulted in a three-fold increase of the AUC of Solifenacin. Therefore, the maximum dose of Solifenacin Succinate should be restricted to 5 mg when used simultaneously with Ketoconazole or therapeutic doses of other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. Ritonavir, Nelfinavir, Itraconazole). Simultaneous treatment of Solifenacin and a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor is contra-indicated in patients with severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment. The effects of enzyme induction on the pharmacokinetics of Solifenacin and its metabolites have not been studied as well as the effect of higher affinity CYP3A4 substrates on Solifenacin exposure. Since Solifenacin is metabolised by CYP3A4, pharmacokinetic interactions are possible with other CYP3A4 substrates with higher affinity (e.g. Verapamil, Diltiazem) and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. Rifampicin, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine). Effect of Solifenacin on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products: \n\nOral Contraceptives: Intake of Solifenacin showed no pharmacokinetic interaction on combined oral contraceptives (Ethinylestradiol/Levonorgestrel).\nWarfarin: Intake of Solifenacin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R-warfarin or S-warfarin or their effect on prothrombin time.\nDigoxin: Intake of Solifenacin showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.\nEffects on ability to drive and use machines: Since Solifenacin, like other anticholinergics may cause blurred vision and, uncommonly, somnolence and fatigue, the ability to drive and use machines may be negatively affected.",
    "Contraindications": "Solifenacin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to solifenacin or to any of the excipients. It is also contraindicated in myasthenia gravis, urinary retention, uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma, severe gastro-intestinal condition (including toxic megacolon), patients undergoing haemodialysis, patients with severe hepatic impairment, patients with severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment and on treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, e.g. ketoconazole.",
    "Side Effects": "Due to the pharmacological effect of Solifenacin, it may cause anticholinergic undesirable effects of (in general) mild or moderate severity. The frequency of anticholinergic undesirable effects is dose related. The most commonly reported adverse reactionwith Solifenacin is dry mouth. It occurred in 11% of patients treated with 5 mg once daily, in 22% of patients treated with 10 mg once daily and in 4% of placebo-treated patients. The severity of dry mouth was generally mild and only occasionally led to discontinuation of treatment. In general,medicinal product compliance was very high (approximately 99%) and approximately 90% of the patients treated with Solifenacin completed the full study period of 12 weeks treatment.\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: very common- dry mouth, common-constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, uncommon- gastroesophageal reflux diseases, dry throat, rare- colonic obstruction, faecal impaction, very rare- vomiting.\nInfections and infestations: uncommonurinary tract infection, cystitis.\nnervous system disorders: uncommon- somnolence, dysgeusia, very rare-dizziness, headache.\npsychiatric disorders: very rare- hallucinations.\neye disorders: common- blurred vision, uncommon- dry eyes.\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: uncommon- fatigue, peripheral oedema.\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: uncommon nasal dryness.\nskin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: uncommon- dry skin, very rare- pruritus, rash, urticaria.\nrenal and urinary disorders: uncommon- difficulty in micturition, rare- urinary retention.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "No clinical data are available from women who became pregnant while taking Solifenacin. Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects on fertility, embryonal / foetal development or parturition. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. No data on the excretion of Solifenacin in human milk are available. In mice, Solifenacin and/or its metabolites was excreted in milk, and caused a dose dependent failure to thrive in neonatal mice. The use of Solifenacin should therefore be avoided during breast-feeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Other causes of frequent urination (heart failure or renal disease) should be assessed before treatment with Solifenacin Succinate. If urinary tract infection is present, an appropriate antibacterial therapy should be started. Solifenacin Succinate should be used with caution in patients with: clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction at risk of urinary retention, gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, risk of decreased gastrointestinal motility, severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 ml/min), moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7 to 9) and doses should not exceed 5 mg for these patients. Caution should be taken in concomitant use of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor e.g. Ketoconazole, hiatus hernia/ gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking medicinal products (such as Bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate oesophagitis, autonomic neuropathy. Safety and efficacy have not yet been established in patients with a neurogenic cause for detrusor overactivity. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. The maximum effect of Solifenacin Succinate can be determined after 4 weeks at the earliest.",

No definitive cause was identified for this finding.UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 Substrates: Systemic exposure to substrates of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 may increase when co-administered with SorafenibDocetaxel: Concomitant use of Docetaxel (75 or 100 mg/m2 administered every 21 days) with Sorafenib (200 or 400 mg twice daily), administered with a 3-day break in dosing around administration of Docetaxel, resulted in a 36-80% increase in Docetaxel AUC and a 16-32% increase in Docetaxel Cmax. Caution is recommended when Sorafenib is co-administered with DocetaxelDoxorubicin: Concomitant treatment with Sorafenib resulted in a 21% increase in the AUC of Doxorubicin. Caution is recommended when administering Doxorubicin with Sorafenib.Fluorouracil: Both increases (21%-47%) and decreases (10%) in the AUC of Fluorouracil were observed with concomitant treatment with Sorafenib. Caution is recommended when Sorafenib is co-administered with Fluorouracil/Leucovorin.CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 Substrates: Systemic exposure to substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 is expected to increase when co-administered with Sorafenib.CYP3A4 Inducers: Continuous concomitant administration of Sorafenib and Rifampicin resulted in an average 37% reduction of Sorafenib AUC. Other inducers of CYP3A4 activity (for example, Hypericum perforatum also known as St. John\u2019s wort, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, and Dexamethasone) may also increase metabolism of Sorafenib and thus decrease Sorafenib concentrations.CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP Isoform Substrates: Sorafenib metabolism is unlikely to be altered by CYP3A4 inhibitors and is unlikely to alter the metabolism of substrates of these enzymes.P-glycoprotein Substrates: Sorafenib is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in vitro, therefore may increase the concentrations of concomitant drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates.CYP Enzyme Induction: CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activities were not altered after treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with Sorafenib, indicating that Sorafenib is unlikely to be an inducer of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4.Combination with other Antineoplastic Agents: Sorafenib had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine or oxaliplatin.Neomycin: Coadministration of Sorafenib with oral Neomycin should be carefully considered because average plasma exposure (AUC) of Sorafenib was decreased by 54%.",

Risk of Hemorrhage: An increased risk of bleeding may occur following Sorafenib administration. There was one fatal hemorrhage in each treatment group in RCC Study. If any bleeding necessitates medical intervention, permanent discontinuation of Sorafenib should be considered.Risk of Hypertension: In the HCC study, hypertension was reported in approximately 9.4% and In RCC Study, hypertension was reported in approximately 16.9% of Sorafenib -treated patients. In cases of severe or persistent hypertension, despite institution of antihypertensive therapy, temporary or permanent discontinuation of Sorafenib should be considered.Risk of Dermatologic Toxicities: Hand-foot skin reaction and rash represent the most common adverse reactions attributed to Sorafenib.Risk of Gastrointestinal Perforation: In the event of a gastrointestinal perforation, Sorafenib therapy should be discontinued.Warfarin Co-Administration: Patients taking concomitant warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time, INR or clinical bleeding episodes. Wound Healing Complications: Resume Sorafenib therapy following a major surgical intervention should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Use of Sorafenib in combination with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Patients with squamous cell carcinoma (prospectively stratified), higher mortality was observed with the addition of Sorafenib compared to those treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone.Interactions with UGT1A1 Substrates: Sorafenib can cause increases in plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of UGT1A1.Interaction with Docetaxel & Doxorubicin: Sorafenib can cause increases in plasma concentrations of Docetaxel and Doxorubicin.Hepatic Impairment: Hepatic impairment may reduce plasma concentrations of Sorafenib.Neomycin: Co-administration of oral Neomycin causes a decrease in Sorafenib exposure.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Sotagliflozin is an orally delivered dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2. Sotagliflozin improves glycaemic and metabolic control through dual inhibition - local inhibition of SGLT1 in the gut and systemic SGLT2 inhibition in the proximal renal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT1 delays and reduces glucose absorption in the proximal intestine, resulting in a blunting and delay of postprandial hyperglycaemia. Inhibition of SGLT2 reduces renal glucose reabsorption and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Sotagliflozin is administered by the oral route. The recommended dose is 200 mg sotagliflozin once daily before the first meal of the day. After at least three months, if additional glycaemic control is needed, in patients tolerating sotagliflozin 200 mg, the dose may be increased to 400 mg once daily.",
    "Interaction": "Interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers show that Sotagliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, metoprolol, midazolam and oral contraceptives.Insulin: Insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. A lower dose of insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Sotagliflozin",

    "Indications": "Sotorasib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Sotorasib is a potent and highly selective KRASG12C (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) inhibitor, which covalently and irreversibly binds to the unique cysteine of KRASG12C. Inactivation of KRASG12C by Sotorasib blocks tumour cell signalling and survival, inhibits cell growth, and promotes apoptosis selectively in tumours harbouring KRASG12C, an oncogenic driver of tumourigenesis across multiple cancer types. The potency and selectivity of Sotorasib is enhanced through the unique binding to both the P2 pocket and the His95 surface groove, locking the protein in an inactive state that prevents downstream signalling, without affecting wild-type KRAS.Sotorasib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of KRASG12C with minimal detectable off-target activity against other cellular proteins and processes. Sotorasib impaired oncogenic signalling and tumour cell survival at clinically relevant exposures in numerous pre-clinical models expressing KRASG12C. Sotorasib also enhanced antigen presentation and inflammatory cytokine production only in tumour cells with KRASG12C. Sotorasib induced anti-tumour inflammatory responses and immunity, driving permanent and complete tumour regressions in immunocompetent mice implanted with KRASG12C expressing tumours.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dosage of Sotorasib is 960 mg (eight 120 mg tablets) orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Take Sotorasib at the same time each day with or without food. Swallow tablets whole. Do not chew, crush or split tablets. If a dose of Sotorasib is missed by more than 6 hours, take the next dose as prescribed the next day. Do not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for the missed dose. If vomiting occurs after taking Sotorasib, do not take an additional dose. Take the next dose as prescribed the next day.",
    "Interaction": "Effects of other medicinal products on Sotorasib-Acid-reducing agents: Coadministration of Sotorasib with gastric acidreducing agents decreased Sotorasib concentrations, which may reduce the efficacy of Sotorasib. Avoid coadministration of Sotorasib with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists, and locally acting antacids. If coadministration with an acidreducing agent cannot be avoided, administer Sotorasib 4 hours before or 10 hours after administration of a locally acting antacid.Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Coadministration of Sotorasib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased Sotorasib concentrations, which may reduce the efficacy of Sotorasib. Avoid coadministration of SOTORASIB with strong CYP3A4 inducers.Effect of Sotorasib on other medicinal products-CYP3A4 substrates: Coadministration of Sotorasib with a CYP3A4 substrate decreased its plasma concentrations, which may reduce the efficacy of the substrate. Avoid coadministration of Sotorasib with CYP3A4 sensitive substrates, for which minimal concentration changes may lead to therapeutic failures of the substrate. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information.P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates: Coadministration of Sotorasib with a P-gp substrate (digoxin) increased digoxin plasma concentrations, which may increase the adverse reactions of digoxin. Avoid coadministration of Sotorasib with P-gp substrates, for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities. If coadministration cannot be avoided, decrease the P-gp substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information.",
    "Contraindications": "Not available",
    "Side Effects": "Two serious adverse effects were reported with the use of Sotorasib: hepatotoxicity and interstitial lung disease (ILD).Hepatotoxicity: Twenty-five percent of trial participants experienced liver dysfunction, resulting in elevated hepatic transaminases, elevated bilirubin, and drug-induced hepatitis. Liver function tests should be performed before starting Sotorasib and every 3 weeks for the first 3 months, then once a month. Liver function tests should include AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels.2 Patients should be instructed to report signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction such as abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, or itching to their oncology team. Sotorasib should be held if a patient develops grade 2, 3, or 4 hepatotoxicity until the symptoms resolve to a grade 1 or better, and then resumed at a lower dose.Interstitial Lung Disease: Although ILD was rare, several trial participants developed the condition. Patients should be evaluated regularly for respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and fever, and should be encouraged to quickly report these symptoms to their healthcare team. If ILD is suspected, Sotorasib should be held while the patient undergoes work-up for their symptoms.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: There are no data from the use of Sotorasib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Patients must be informed of the potential hazards to the foetus if Sotorasib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Sotorasib.Breast-feeding: It is unknown if Sotorasib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Sotorasib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hepatotoxicity: Sotorasib can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis. Among 357 patients who received Sotorasib in Code BreaK 100, hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% (all grades) and 1.4%. (Grade 3). A total of 18% of patients who received Sotorasib had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 6% were Grade 3 and 0.6% were Grade 4. The median time to first onset of increased ALT/AST was 9 weeks (range: 0.3 to 42). Increased ALT/AST leading to dose interruption or reduction occurred in 7% of patients. Sotorasib was discontinued due to increased ALT/AST in 2.0% of patients. In addition to dose interruption or reduction, 5% of patients received corticosteroids for the treatment of hepatotoxicity.Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of Sotorasib, every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue Sotorasib based on severity of adverse reaction.Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Sotorasib can cause ILD/pneumonitis that can be fatal. Among 357 patients who received Sotorasib in CodeBreaK 100, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.8% of patients, all cases were Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 1 case was fatal.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Sparfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and kills many of the types of bacteria that can infect the breathing airways and lungs and has been shown in a large number of clinical trials to be safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial infections. It is found to be more effective in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against some gram positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureous), Mycobacteria and Chlamydia spp.Absorption: Quinoflox\u201a is well absorbed following oral administration with an absolute oral bioavailability of 92%. The mean maximum plasma sparfloxacin concentration following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 1.3 (\u00b10.2) \u00b5g/mL. The area under the curve following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 34 (\u00b16.8) \u00b5g\u00b7hr/mL. Steady-state plasma concentration was achieved on the first day by giving a loading dose that was double the daily dose. Maximum plasma concentrations for a 200 mg dose were also achieved between 3 to 6 hours after administration with a mean of about 4 hours. Oral absorption of sparfloxacin is unaffected by administration with milk or food, including high fat meals. Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide reduces the oral bioavailability of sparfloxacin by as much as 50%.Distribution: Upon reaching general circulation, Quinoflox\u201a distributes well into the body, as reflected by the large mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss ) of 3.9 (\u00b10.8) L/kg. Sparfloxacin exhibits low plasma protein binding in serum at about 45%. Sparfloxacin penetrates well into body fluids and tissues. Results of tissue and body fluid distribution studies demonstrated that oral administration of sparfloxacin produces sustained concentrations and that sparfloxacin concentrations in lower respiratory tract tissues and fluids generally exceed the corresponding plasma concentrations. The concentration of sparfloxacin in respiratory tissues (pulmonary parenchyma, bronchial wall, and bronchial mucosa) at 2 to 6 hours following standard oral dosing was approximately 3 to 6 times greater than the corresponding concentration in plasma. Concentrations in these respiratory tissues increase at up to 24 hours following dosing. Sparfloxacin is also highly concentrated into alveolar macrophages compared to plasma. Mean pleural effusion to plasma concentration ratios were 0.34 and 0.69 at 4 and 20 hours postdose, respectively.Metabolism: Quinoflox\u201a is metabolised by the liver, primarily by phase II glucuronidation, to form a glucuronide conjugate. Its metabolism does not utilize or interfere with cytochrome-mediated oxidation, in particular cytochrome P450.Excretion: The total body clearance and renal clearance of Quinoflox\u201a were 11.4 (\u00b13.5) and 1.5 (\u00b10.5) L/hr, respectively. Sparfloxacin is excreted in both the feces (50%) and urine (50%). Approximately 10% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in patients with normal renal function.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin\u201a in patients with normal renal function is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200 mg tablet should be taken every 24 hours for a total of 10 days of therapy (11 tablets). The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin\u201a in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200-mg tablet should be taken every 48 hours for a total of 9 days of therapy (6 tablets).",

    "name": "Spironolactone",
    "generic_id": "1015",
    "Indications": "Spironolactone tablet is indicated for the management of oedema and ascites in cirrhosis of the liver, malignant ascites, nephrotic syndrome, congestive heart failure and primary hyperaldosteronism.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Spironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone interacts with a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor to enhance the expression of the Na+K+ ATPase and the Na+ channel involved in a Na+K+ transport in the distal tubule. Spironolactone bind to this mineralcorticoid receptor, blocking the actions of aldosterone on gene expression. Aldosterone is a hormone; its primary function is to retain sodium and excrete potassium in the kidneys.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Primary hyperaldosteronism: Spironolactone may be employed as an initial diagnostic measure to provide presumptive evidence of primary hyperaldosteronism while patients are on normal diets.Long test: Spironolactone is administered at a daily dosage of 400 mg for three to four weeks. Correction of hypokalemia and of hypertension provides presumptive evidence for the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism.Short test: Spironolactone is administered at a daily dosage of 400 mg for four days. If serum potassium increases during Spironolactone administration but drops when Spironolactone is discontinued, a presumptive diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism should be considered. After the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism has been established by more definitive testing procedures, it may be administered in doses of 75 mg to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For those unsuitable for surgery, spironolactone may be employed for long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual. Edema in adults (congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome): An initial daily dosage of 50-100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, Spironolactone should be continued for at least five days at the initial dosage level, after which it may be adjusted to the optimal therapeutic or maintenance level administered in either single or divided daily doses. If, after five days, an adequate diuretic response to Spironolactone has not occurred, a second diuretic which acts more proximally in the renal tubule may be added to the regimen. Because of the additive effect of Spironolactone when administered concurrently with such diuretics, an enhanced diuresis usually begins on the first day of combined treatment; combined therapy is indicated when more rapid diuresis is desired. The dosage of Spironolactone should remain unchanged when other diuretic therapy is added.Essential hypertension: For adults, an initial daily dosage of 50 to 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Spironolactone may also be given with diuretics which act more proximally in the renal tubule or with other antihypertensive agents. Treatment with Spironolactone should be continued for at least two weeks, since the maximum response may not occur before this time. Subsequently, dosage should be adjusted according to the response of the patient.Hypokalemia: Spironolactone in a dosage ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg daily is useful in treating a diuretic-induced hypokalemia, when oral potassium supplements or other potassium-sparing regimens are considered inappropriate.",
    "Interaction": "The administration of potassium supplements, a diet rich in potassium, including salt substitutes, or of other potassium sparing agents is not recommended as it may induce hyperkalemia. Severe hyperkalemia has been reported in patients co-administered potassium-sparing diuretics, including Spironolactone and ACE inhibitors. Spironolactone reduces the vascular responsiveness to noradrenaline. Therefore caution should be exercised in the management of patient subjected to regional or general anaesthesia while they are being treated with Spironolactone. Aspirin attenuates the diuretic effect of Spironolactone by blocking the secretion ofcanrenone in the renal tubule. Indomethacin and Mefenamic Acid have been shown to inhibit the excretion of canrenone. As carbenoxolone may cause sodium retention and thus may decrease the effectiveness of Spironolactone, concurrent use of the two agents should be avoided. Spironolactone enhances the metabolism of antipyrine.",
    "Contraindications": "Acute renal insufficiency, significant impairment of renal function, anuria, hyperkalemia or sensitivity to Spironolactone.",
    "Side Effects": "Gynaecomastia may develop in association with the use of Spironolactone. The development of gynaecomastia appears to be related to both dosage level & duration of therapy and is normally reversible when Spironolactone is discontinued. In rare instances, some breast enlargement may persist. Other adverse reactions that have been reported in association with Spironolactone are: gastrointestinal symptoms including cramping and diarrhoea, drowsiness, lethargy, headache, maculopapular or erythematous cutaneous eruptions, urticaria, mental confusion, drug fever, ataxia, impotence, irregular menses or amenorrhoea, and post-menopausal bleeding. Adverse reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The effects of Spironolactone during pregnancy have not been adequately studied. Spironolactone appears in breast milk and could affect a nursing infant.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "All patients receiving diuretic therapy should be observed for evidence of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, eg, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hyperkalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Hyperkalemia may occur in patients with impaired renal function or excessive potassium intake and can cause cardiac irregularities, which may be fatal. Consequently, no potassium supplement should ordinarily be given with Spironolactone.",

    "generic_id": "1016",
    "Indications": "Streptokinase is indicated for:Systemic administration-\n\nacute transmural myocardial infarction (not older than 12 hours), with persistent ST-segment elevation or recent left bundle-branch block\ndeep vein thromboses (not older than 14 days)\nacute massive pulmonary embolism ...

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Streptokinase acts with plasminogen to produce an activator complex that converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. Unlike other plasminogen activators, Streptokinase is not an enzyme and does not directly convert plasminogen to plasmin. Instead, Streptokinase forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen. Formation of this complex induces a conformational change in plasminogen that exposes its active site. This conformationally altered plasminogen then converts additional plasminogen molecules to plasmin.Pharmacokinetics: Plasma Streptokinase concentrations reach a peak at 2 to 3 min after intravenous administration and peak fibrinolytic activity occurs at approximately 30 min depending on the dose. Streptokinase is cleared from the plasma in two phases. The first phase has an average half life of 18 min, and is caused by the presence of antistreptokinase antibody which combines with Streptokinase to produce a complex that is cleared rapidly from the circulation. The second phase is slower, with a half life of approximately 80 min, and reflects the rate at which Streptokinase combines with plasminogen. Hence, the clearance rate will vary according to the availability of plasminogen and the dosage regimen used.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Acute evolving transmural MI: Administer as soon as possible after symptom onset. The greatest benefit in mortality reduction was observed when Streptokinase was administered within 4 hours, but statistically significant benefit has been reported up to 24 hours.\n\nIV infusion- Administer a total dose of 1500000 IU within 60 minutes.\nIntracoronary infusion- Administer 20000 IU by bolus followed by 2000 IU/min for 60 minutes for a total dose of 140000 IU.\n\nPE, DVT, arterial thrombosis, or embolism: Institute treatment as soon as possible after thrombotic event onset, preferably within 7 days. Any delay in instituting lytic therapy to evaluate the effect of heparin therapy decreases the potential for optimal efficacy. Because human exposure to streptococci is common, antibodies to Streptokinase are prevalent. Thus, a loading dose of Streptokinase sufficient to neutralize these antibodies is required. A dose of 250000 IU Streptokinase infused into a peripheral vein over 30 minutes was appropriate in over 90% of patients. If the thrombin time, or any other parameter of lysis after 4 hours of therapy is not significantly different from the normal control level, discontinue Streptokinase because excessive resistance is present.AV cannulae occlusion: Before using, try to clear the cannula by syringe technique, using heparinized saline solution. If adequate flow is not re-established, use Streptokinase. Allow the effect of any pretreatment anticoagulants to diminish. Slowly instill 250000 IU in 2 mL solution into each occluded limb of the cannula. Clamp off cannula limb(s) for 2 hours. Observe closely for adverse effects. After treatment, aspirate contents of infused cannula limb(s), flush with saline, and reconnect cannula.Pediatric use: Controlled clinical studies have not been conducted in children to determine safety and efficacy. The evidence of clinical benefits and risks is solely based on anecdotal reports in patients ranging in age from less than 1 month to 16 years. The largest number of patient reports has pertained to the use of Streptokinase in arterial occlusions. For arterial occlusions, the most frequently used loading dose was 1000 IU/kg; fewer numbers of patients received 3000 IU/kg. Loading dose durations typically have ranged from 5 to 30 minutes. Continuous infusion doses were frequently 1000 IU/kg/h; fewer were at 1500 IU/kg/h. Infusions were maintained for 12 hours or less in approximately half of the published cases; a smaller proportion were between 12 and 24 hours. Reported adverse events associated with the use of Streptokinase in the pediatric population are similar in nature to those associated with its use in adults. Rates of all bleeding complications have been variable and as high as 50% at catheter sites in some studies. Occasionally, bleeding has required transfusion. Careful monitoring of patient status is necessary.",
    "Interaction": "Potentially hazardous interactions: Early administration of Heparin or Hirudin therapy may increase the risk of hemorrhage. Systemic fibrinogenolysis, which inevitably occurs during Streptokinase therapy, impairs coagulation both by causing fibrinogen depletion and through the anti-thrombin effects of fibrin degradation products. This may help protect recanalized vessels from reocclusion and may explain the lack of additional benefit from Heparin. Conversely, early Heparin or Hirudin therapy may increase the risk of hemorrhage.Radiological contrast agents: Some radiological contrast agents such as Diatrizoate and Iohexol, but not ioxaglate, are inhibitors of fibrinolysis by Streptokinase and this may be clinically important. Potentially useful interactions:Antiplatelet therapy: Low-dose aspirin enhances survival in myocardial infarct patients receiving Streptokinase, without increasing the risk of major hemorrhage. Data are presently inadequate to assess the interaction of Streptokinase with more powerful inhibitors of platelet function.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindications-\n\nBleeding diathesis or active internal bleeding\nRecent trauma (e.g. head injury. resuscitation)\nSevere uncontrollable hypertension\nStroke or recent cerebrovascular accident\nIntracranial or intraspinal surgery\nKnown intracranial neoplasm\nSevere uncontrollable hypertension\nUncontrollable clotting disorders\nKnown allergy to Streptokinase\n\r\nRelative contraindications-\n\nAll forms of reduced blood coagulability, in particular spontaneous fibrinolysis\nLocal lesions with risk of bleeding\nRecent surgery\nRecent abortion or delivery\nDiseases of the urogenital tract with existing or potential sources of bleeding\nRecent streptococcal infections which have produced high antistreptokinase titers\nStreptokinase therapy more than 5 days and less than 12 months previously\nSubacute bacterial endocarditis\nPericarditis\nSevere hypertension or hypertensive retinal changes grades III/IV\nDisorders of cerebral blood flow or recent cerebral hemorrhage\nPulmonary diseases with cavitation or severe bronchitis\nAcute pancreatitis\nAdvanced age with suspicion of arteriosclerotic degeneration\nSeptic thromboembolic disease.",
    "Side Effects": "Potentially life-threatening effects: The unwanted effects of Streptokinase therapy fall into two categories: those resulting from bleeding and those resulting from allergy. Hypotension and arrhythmias may occur in patients with myocardial infarction.Bleeding: Major, life-threatening hemorrhage occurs in 0.2-0.3% of patients. Less severe bleeding has been reported in about 10% of patients. In the event of serious hemorrhage, Streptokinase therapy should be stopped. Antifibrinolytic therapy (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid, or aprotinin) should be considered if there is evidence of persistent fibrinolytic activity in the blood. Transfusions of blood (preferably fresh), cryoprecipitate, or fresh frozen plasma may be necessary. There may also be an excess incidence of cerebral hemorrhage (perhaps 2 per 1000) in patients treated with systemic thrombolytic agents, but there does not appear to be an increase in total strokes- perhaps because of a reduction in ischemic strokes.Allergic reactions: The incidence of allergic reactions appears to have fallen with the introduction of more highly purified forms of Streptokinase. The incidence of anaphylactic shock is 0.1%. Severe allergic reactions, including death, have been reported in patients with no history of previous exposure to Streptokinase. Less severe allergic phenomena. such as chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, and high fever, have been reported in between 2 and 20% of patients. The immunological basis of allergic reactions to Streptokinase is not entirely clear. Investigation of patients who have suffered allergic reactions have demonstrated low titers of antistreptokinase IgG and IgG1. There was no evidence of any other 1gG subclass nor of specific antistreptokinase IgE. There is also evidence of cell-mediated immunity with at least five antigenic epitopes on the Streptokinase molecule which are recognized by human CD4+T-cell receptor \u03b1\u03b2+T cells. Allergic reactions usually respond well to withdrawal of therapy, intravenous hydrocortisone and antihistamines. Although some authorities recommend the use of prophylactic intravenous hydrocortisone, there is no good evidence that this is of value.Acute overdosage: In view of the mode of use of this drug overdosage is very unlikely and has not been reported. It would lead to hemorrhage.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "It is not known whether Streptokinase can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Use these drugs during pregnancy only if clearly needed. No information is available on the presence of Streptokinase in breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "High Risk Patients: Carefully evaluate each patient being considered for therapy and weigh anticipated benefits against potential risks associated with therapy.In the following conditions, the risk of therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the anticipated benefits:\n\nRecent (within 10 days) major surgery (eg, obstetrical delivery, organ biopsy, previous puncture of noncompressible vessels)\nRecent (within 10 days) serious gastrointestinal bleeding\nRecent (within 10 days) trauma including cardiopulmonary resuscitation\nHypertension (systolic BP more than 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP more than 110 mm Hg)\nLikelihood of left heart thrombus (eg, mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation)\nSubacute bacterial endocarditis\nCerebrovascular disease\nHemostatic defects including secondary to severe hepatic or renal disease\nPregnancy\nAge over 75 years\nDiabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy\nSeptic thrombophlebitis or occluded AV cannula at a seriously infected site\nAny other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be particularly difficult to manage because of its location\n\nArrhythmias: Rapid lysis of coronary thrombi has been shown to cause reperfusion atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias requiring immediate treatment. Carefully monitor for arrhythmias during and immediately following administration of Streptokinase for AMI. Occasionally, tachycardia and bradycardia have been observed.Hypotension: Sometimes severe hypotension, not secondary to bleeding or anaphylaxis, may occur during or soon after IV Streptokinase (1% to 10%). Closely monitor patients and, if symptomatic or alarming hypotension occurs, administer appropriate treatment. This may include a decrease in the IV Streptokinase infusion rate. Smaller hypotensive effects are common and have not required treatment.Injection sites: If an arterial puncture is necessary, upper extremity vessels are preferable. Apply pressure for at least 30 minutes. Apply a pressure dressing and check puncture site frequently.Respiratory: There have been reports of respiratory depression in patients receiving Streptokinase. In some cases, it was not possible to determine whether the respiratory depression was associated with Streptokinase or was a symptom of the underlying process. If respiratory depression is associated with Streptokinase, the occurrence is believed to be rare.Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema: Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema has been reported rarely in patients treated with Streptokinase. The risk of this appears greatest in patients who have large MIs undergoing thrombolytic therapy by the intracoronary route.Polyneuropathy: Rarely polyneuropathy has been temporally related to the use of Streptokinase, with some cases described as Gaillain-Barre syndrome.Anticoagulant and antiplatelets after treatment for MI: In the treatment of AMI, aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of reinfarction and stroke. The addition of aspirin to Streptokinase causes a minimal increase in the risk of minor bleeding (3.9% vs 3.1%) but does not appear to increase the incidence of major bleeding. In the treatment of AMI, aspirin, when not otherwise contraindicated, should be administered with Streptokinase. The use of anticoagulants following Streptokinase administration increases the risk of bleeding but has not been shown to be of unequivocal clinical benefit. Therefore, whereas the use of aspirin is recommended unless otherwise contraindicated, the use of anticoagulants should be decided by the treating physician.Anticoagulation after IV treatment for other indications: Continuous IV infusion of heparin, without a loading dose, has been recommended following termination of Streptokinase, infusion for treatment of PE or DVT to prevent rethrombosis. The effect of Streptokinase on thrombin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) usually will diminish within 3 to 4 hours after Streptokinase therapy. Heparin therapy without a loading dose can be initiated when the TT or the aPTT is less than twice the normal control value for Streptokinase.Cholesterol embolism: Cholesterol embolism has occurred rarely in patients treated with all types of thrombolytic agents; the true incidence is unknown. This serious condition, which can be lethal, is also associated with invasive vascular procedures (eg, cardiac catheterization, angiography, vascular surgery) and/or anticoagulant therapy. Clinical features of cholesterol embolism include livedo reticularis, \"purple toe\" syndrome, acute renal failure, gangrenous digits, hypertension, pancreatitis, Ml, cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, retinal artery occlusion, bowel infarction, and rhabdomyolysis.PE: If PE or recurrent PE occur during Streptokinase therapy, complete the planned course of treatment in an attempt to lyse the embolus. While PE may occasionally occur during Streptokinase treatment, the incidence is no greater than when patients are treated with heparin alone. In addition to PE, embolization to other sites during Streptokinase treatment has been observed.Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions ranging in severity from minor breathing difficulty to bronchospasm, periorbital swelling, or angioneurotic edema have been observed rarely in patients treated with IV Streptokinase. Fever and shivering, occurring in 1% to 4% of patients, are the most commonly reported allergic reactions with IV Streptokinase in AMI. Other milder allergic effects, such as urticaria, itching, flushing, nausea, headache, and musculoskeletal pain, have been observed, as have delayed hypersensitivity reactions such as vasculitis and interstitial nephritis.",

Besides, Sucralfate inhibits the action of pepsin and bile.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, chronic gastritis-\n\nAdults: The usual dose is Sucralfate 2 gm twice daily to be taken on rising and at bedtime or Sucralfate 1 gm four times a day to be taken 1 hour before meals and at bedtime.

To prevent clogging of the nasogastric tube flush with 10 ml of water following each administration. The duration of treatment for prophylaxis of stress ulceration must be individually determined. Treatment should be continued for as long as one or more of the risk factors for stress ulceration is present but normally not for more than 14 days.\n\r\nSucralfate should be taken on an empty stomach. Antacid should not be administered within 30 minutes of Sucralfate.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant administration of Sucralfate may reduce the bioavailability of certain drugs including Fluoroquinolones such as Ciprofloxacin and Norfloxacin, Tetracycline, Ketoconazole, Sulpiride, Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenytoin, Theophylline, Levothyroxine, Quinidine, and H2 antagonists. The bioavailability of these agents may be restored by separating the administration of these agents from Sucralfate by two hours. This interaction appears to be non-systemic in origin presumably resulting from these agents being bound by Sucralfate in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the potential of Sucralfate to alter the absorption of some drugs from the gastrointestinal tract, the separate administration of Sucralfate from that of other agents should be considered when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical for concomitantly administered drugs. Sucralfate should not be co-administered with citrate preparations. Co-administration citrate preparations with sucralfate may increase the blood concentrations of aluminium. The mechanism may be due to the chelation of aluminium which is assumed to increase its absorption. The administration of Sucralfate\u00a0\u00a0 1 g and enteral feeds by nasogastric tube should be separated by one hour in patients receiving Sucralfate 1 g for the prophylaxis of stress ulceration.

Sucralfate is not recommended for use in individuals on dialysis. In patients with severe or chronic renal impairment, Sucralfate should be used with extreme caution and only for short-term treatment. Small amounts of aluminium are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and aluminium may accumulate. Aluminium osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, encephalopathy and anaemia have been reported in patients with chronic renal impairment. For patients with impairment of renal function, laboratory testing such as aluminium, phosphate, calcium and alkaline phosphatase is recommended to be periodically performed due to excretion impairment. The concomitant use of other aluminium containing medications is not recommended in view of the enhanced potential for aluminium absorption and toxicity. Bezoars have been reported after administration of sucralfate mainly to severely ill patients in intensive care units. The majority of these patients (including neonates in whom sucralfate is not recommended) had underlying conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying due to surgery, drug therapy or diseases that reduce motility) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feeding.",

The chlorine atoms also provide heat stability, enabling sucralose to withstand of cooking and baking without losing sweetness. Sucralose is not broken down for energy in the body. So it has no calorie. The sucralose molecule passes through the body unchanged, is not metabolized and is eliminated after consumption. Sucralose does not cause tooth decay, has no effect on carbohydrate metabolism, no effect on fetal or neonatal development because sucralose is not actively transported across the blood-brain barrier, the placental barrier or the mammary gland. Sucralose is non-interference in the utilization and absorption of glucose, metabolism of carbohydrates and secretion of insulin.

In the aqueous environment of the Gl tract, phosphate binding takes place by ligand exchange between hydroxyl groups and/or water in Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide and the phosphate in the diet. The bound phosphate is eliminated with feces. Both serum phosphorus levels and calcium-phosphorus product levels are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide tablets should be chewed or crushed. Do not swallow whole. The recommended starting dose of Dephos is 3 tablets (1,500 mg) per day, administered as 1 tablet (500 mg) 3 times daily with meals. Monitor serum phosphorus levels and titrate the dose of Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide in decrements or increments of 500 mg (1 tablet) per day as needed until an acceptable serum phosphorus level is reached, with regular monitoring afterwards. Titrate as often as weekly. Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide must be administered with meals. To maximize the dietary phosphate binding, distribute the total daily dose among meals. No additional fluid above the amount usually taken by the patient is required. If one or more doses of DephosrM are missed, the medication should be resumed with the next meal. Do not attempt to replace a missed dose.Pediatric use: The safety and efficacy of Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide have not been established in pediatric patients.",

    "Interaction": "Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as Ketoconazole may increase Sunitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential is recommended. Concurrent administration of Sutinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, Ketoconazole, resulted in 49% and 51% increases in the combined (Sunitinib + primary active metabolite) Cmax and AUC0-\u221e values, respectively, after a single dose of Sutinib in healthy volunteers. Coadministration of Sutinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Clarithromycin, Atazanavir, Indinavir, Nefazodone, Nelfinavir, Ritonavir, Saquinavir, Telithromycin, Voriconazole) may increase Sunitinib concentrations. Grapefruit may also increase plasma s of Sunitinib. A dose reduction for Sutinib should be considered when it must be coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. CYP3A4 Inducers: CYP3A4 inducers such as Rifampin may decrease Sunitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential is recommended. Concurrent administration of Sutinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, Rifampin, resulted in a 23% and 46% reduction in the combined (Sunitinib + primary active metabolite) Cmax and AUC0-\u221e values, respectively, after a single dose of Sutinib in healthy volunteers. Coadministration of Sutinib with inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., Dexamethasone, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentin, Phenobarbital, St. John\u2019s Wort) may decrease Sunitinib concentrations. St. John\u2019s Wort may decrease Sunitinib plasma concentrations unpredictably. Patients receiving Sutinib should not take St. John\u2019s Wort concomitantly.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Suvorexant is a highly selective antagonist for orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R. The mechanism by which Suvorexant exerts its therapeutic efect in insomnia is presumed to be through antagonism of orexin receptors. The orexin neuropeptide signaling system is a central promoter of wakefulness.

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/1027/suxamethonium-chloride": {
    "name": "Suxamethonium Chloride",
    "generic_id": "1027",
    "Indications": "Suxamethonium Chloride is a short-acting depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. It is used in anesthesia as a muscle relaxant to-\n\nFacilitate endotracheal intubation\nAid in mechanical ventilation and\nAssist a wide range of surgical and obstetric procedures",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Suxamethonium is a muscle relaxant. It acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker by imitating the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Suxamethonium acts on muscle type nicotinic receptors. Binding of Suxamethonium to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor results in opening of the receptor's nicotinic sodium channel; sodium moves into the cell, a disorganized depolarization of the motor-end plate occurs and calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This results in fasciculation. In the normal muscle, following depolarization, acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase and the muscle cell is able to 'reset' ready for the next signal. But Suxamethonium is degraded not by acetylcholinesterase, rather by butyrylcholinesterase, a plasma cholinesterase. This hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase is much slower than that of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase. Thus Suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine and it does not allow the muscle cell to 'reset' and keeps the 'new' resting membrane potential below threshold. When acetylcholine binds to an already depolarized receptor it cannot cause further depolarization. Calcium is removed from the muscle cell cytosol independent of repolarization. As the calcium is taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle relaxes. This explains muscle flaccidity rather than tetany following fasciculation.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Suxamethonium Chloride is usually administered by bolus Intravenous or Intramuscular injection.Adults: The dose of Suxamethonium is dependent on body weight, the degree of muscular relaxation required, the route of administration and the response of individual patients. To achieve endotracheal intubation Suxamethonium is usually administered intravenously in a dose of 1 mg/kg. This dose will usually produce muscular relaxation in about 30-60 seconds and has a duration of action of about 2-6 minutes. Supplementary doses of Suxamethonium of 50%-100% of the initial dose administered at 5-10 minutes intervals will maintain muscle relaxation during short surgical procedures performed under general anesthesia. For prolonged surgical procedures Suxamethonium may be given by intravenous infusion as a 0.1 %-0.2% solution, diluted in 5 % glucose solution or sterile isotonic saline solution, at a rate of 2.5 to 4 mg per minute. The infusion rate should be adjusted according to the response of individual patients. The total dose of Suxamethonium given by repeated intravenous injection or continuous infusion should not be exceeded 500 mg per hour.Children: Infants and young children are more resistant to Suxamethonium compared with adults. The recommended intravenous dose of Suxamethonium for infants is 2 mg/kg. A dose of 1 mg/kg in older children is recommended. When Suxamethonium is given as intravenous infusion in children, the dosage is as for adults with a proportionately lower initial Infusion rate based on body weight. Suxamethonium may be given intramuscularly to infants at doses up to 4-5 mg/kg and in older children up to 4 mg/kg. These doses produce muscular relaxation within about 3 minutes. A total dose of 150 mg should not be exceeded.",
    "Interaction": "Certain drugs or chemicals are known to reduce normal plasma cholinesterase activity and may therefore prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of Suxamethonium. These include: trimetaphan; specific anticholinesterase agents: neostigmine, pyridostigmine, physostigmine; cytotoxic compounds: cyclophosphamide, mechlorethamine, triethylene-melamine; psychiatric drugs: promazine and chlorpromazine, anesthetic agents and drugs: ketamine, morphine and morphine antagonists, pethidine, pancuronium.",
    "Contraindications": "Suxamethonium has no effect on the level of consciousness and should not be administered to a patient who is notfullyanesthetized. Suxamethonium should not be administered to patients known to be hypersensitive to the drug. Suxamethonium is contraindicated in patients known to have an inherited atypical plasma cholinesterase activity. An acute transient rise in serum potassium often occurs following the administration of Suxamethonium in normal individuals (usually 0.5 mmol/Litre). But in certain pathological states it may cause excessive increase in serum potassium leading to serious cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. For this reason, use of Suxamethonium is contraindicated in patients recovering from major trauma, patients recovering from severe burns, patients with neurological deficits involving acute major muscle wasting and patients with pre-existing hyperkalemia. Suxamethonium causes a slight transient rise in intra-ocular pressure, and should therefore not be used in the presence of open eye injuries. The injection is contraindicated in new-born infants, especially in immature neonates.",
    "Side Effects": "Cardiovascular: bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmias. Respiratory: bronchospasm, prolonged respiratory depression and apnea. Musculoskeletal: muscle fasciculation, post-operative muscle pains, myoglobinemia. Others: hyperthermia, increased intra-ocular pressure increased intra-gastric pressure, rash, excessive salivation.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Although Suxamethonium does not readily cross the placental barrier it should not be administered to pregnant women unless the potential benefit outweighs possible hazards.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Suxamethonium should be administered only by or under close supervision of an anesthetist familiar with its action, characteristics and hazards, who is skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only where there are adequate facilities for immediate endotracheal intubation with administration of oxygen by intermittent positive pressure ventilation. The elderly may be more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias, especially if digitalis-like drugs are also being taken.",

    "Contraindications": "Tamoxifen must not be administered during pregnancy. Tamoxifen should not be given to patients who have experienced hypersensitivity to the product or any of its ingredients.",
    "Side Effects": "Side effects can be classified as either due to the pharmacological action of the drug, e.g., hot flushes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, pruritus vulvae and tumour flare or as more general side effects, e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, light-headedness and occasionally fluid retention and alopecia. When such side effects are severe, it may be possible to control them by a simple reduction of dosage (within the recommended dose range) without loss of control of the disease.\u00a0Skin rashes including isolated reports of erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome and bullous pemphigoid and rare hypersensitivity reactions, including angio-oedema have been reported. A small number of patients with bony metastases have developed hypercalcaemia on initiation of therapy.Falls in platelet count, usually only to 80,000-90,000 per/mm3 but occasionally lower, have been reported in patients taking Tamoxifen for breast cancer.A number of cases of visual disturbances including infrequent reports of corneal changes and retinopathy have been described in patients receiving Tamoxifen therapy. An increased incidence of cataracts has been reported in association with the administration of the drug. Uterine fibroids and endometrial changes including hyperplasia and polyps have been reported. Cystic ovarian swellings have occasionally been observed in premenopausal women receiving Tamoxifen.Leucopenia has been observed following the administration of Tamoxifen, sometimes in association with anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia has been reported on rare occasions; this can sometimes be severe. There is evidence of an increased incidence of thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during Tamoxifen therapy.Tamoxifen has been associated with changes in liver enzyme levels and on rare occasions with a spectrum of more severe liver abnormalities, including fatty liver, cholestasis and hepatitis. Rarely, elevation of serum triglyceride levels, in some cases with pancreatitis, may be associated with the use of Tamoxifen.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Tamoxifen must not be administered during pregnancy. There have been a small number of reports of spontaneous abortions, birth defects and foetal deaths after women have taken Tamoxifen, although no causal relationship has been established. Reproductive toxicology studies in rats, rabbits and monkeys have shown no teratogenic potential. Women should be advised not to become pregnant whilst taking Tamoxifen and should use barrier or other nonhormonal contraceptive methods if sexually active. Premenopausal patients must be carefully examined before treatment to exclude pregnancy. Women should be informed of the potential risks to the foetus, if they want to become pregnant whilst taking Tamoxifen or within two months of cessation of therapy.Lactation: It is not known if Tamoxifen is excreted in human milk and therefore the drug is not recommended during lactation. The decision to discontinue Tamoxifen should take into account in case of the importance of the drug to the lactating mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Menstruation is suppressed in a proportion of premenopausal women receiving Tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer. An increased incidence of endometrial cancer has seen reported in association with Tamoxifen treatment. The underlying mechanism is unknown, but may be related to the oestrogen-like effect of Tamoxifen. Any patients receiving or having previously received Tamoxifen, who report abnormal gynaecological symptoms, especially vaginal bleeding, should be promptly investigated.A number of second primary tumors, occurring at sites other than the endometrium and the opposite breast, have been reported in clinical trials, following the treatment of breast cancer patients with Tamoxifen.

    "Indications": "Tamsulosin Hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of functional symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tamsulosin, a selective alpha1 adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits its selectivity for alpha1\u00a0A adrenoceptors in human prostate. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH. Absorption of Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule 0.4mg is essentially complete (90%) following oral administration under fasting conditions. The time to maximum concentration (Tmax) is reached by four to five hours under fasting conditions and by six to seven hours when administered with food. Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extremely bound to human plasma protein (94% to 99%). Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P 450 enzymes in the liver and less than 10% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged form. Following intravenous or oral administration of an immediate-release formulation the elimination half-life of Tamsulosin hydrochloride in plasma ranges from five to seven hours. Because of the absorption rate controlled pharmacokinetics with Prostam capsules, the apparent half-life of Tamsulosin hydrochloride is approximately 9 to 13 hours in healthy volunteers and 14 to 15 hours in the target population.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Tamsulosin Hydrochloride 0.4 mg (one capsule) daily, to be taken after meal at night. The dose may be increased after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary, to Tamsulosin Hydrochloride 0.8 mg (two capsules) once daily. If Tamsulosin Hydrochloride administration is discontinued or interrupted for several days at either the 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg dose, therapy should be started again with the Tamsulosin Hydrochloride 0.4 mg (one capsule) once daily dose. The capsule should be swallowed whole with a glass of water (about 150 ml) in the standing or sitting position. The capsule should not be crunched or chewed, as this will interfere with the modified release of the active ingredient.",
    "Interaction": "Concurrent administration of other alfa1-adrenoceptor antagonists could lead to hypotensive effects. No interactions have been seen when Tamsulosin was given concomitantly with either atenolol, enalapril or nifedipine. Concomitant cimetidine brings about a rise and frusemide a fall in plasma levels of Tamsulosin, but as levels remain within the normal range posology need not be changed. No interactions at the level of hepatic metabolism have been seen during in vitro studies with liver microsomal fractions (representative of the cytochrome P450-linked drug-metabolizing enzyme system), involving amitriptyline, salbutamol, glibenclamide, and finasteride. Diclofenac and warfarin, however, may increase the elimination rate of Tamsulosin.",
    "Contraindications": "Tamsulosin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it; history of orthostatic hypotension; severe hepatic insufficiency. As with other alpha1 blockers, a reduction in blood pressure can occur in individual cases during treatment with Tamsulosin, as a result of which, rarely, syncope can occur, at the first signs of orthostatic hypotension (dizziness, weakness) the patient should sit or lie down until the symptoms have disappeared. And they should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result (like driving, operating machinery or performing hazardous tasks). Before therapy with Tamsulosin is initiated the patient should be examined in order to exclude the presence of other conditions which can cause the same symptoms as Benign Prostatic hyperplasia. Digital rectal examination and when the necessary determination of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) should be performed before treatment and at regular intervals afterwards.",
    "Side Effects": "The following adverse reactions have been reported during the use of Tamsulosin: dizziness, abnormal ejaculation and; less frequently headache, asthenia, postural hypotension and palpitations.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Use of Tamsulosin in pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Rarely, transient postural symptoms have occurred during orthostatic provocation testing after the first dose. Use in patients with micturition syncope is not advised.Effects on ability to drive and use machines: No data is available on whether Tamsulosin adversely affects the ability to drive or operate machines. However, in this respect, patients should be aware of the fact that dizziness can occur.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tamsulosin & Dutasteride is a combination of two drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to improve symptoms in patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Tamsulosin Hydrochloride, an antagonist of alpha1A-adrenoreceptors and Dutasteride, a dual 5 alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI). Treatment of BPH with alpha1-adrenoreceptor blocking agents and 5ARIs results in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH.Tamsulosin: An alpha1-adrenoreceptor blocking agent that affects the dynamic component of BPH by inhibiting alpha1-adrenoreceptors in the stromal prostatic smooth muscle and bladder neck. Blockade of these adrenoreceptors can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax. Specifically, Tamsulosin exhibits selectivity for both alpha 1A and alpha 1D receptors over the alpha1B-adrenoreceptor subtype. These three adrenoreceptor subtypes have a distinct distribution pattern in human tissue. Whereas approximately 70% of the alpha1-receptors in human prostate are of the alpha 1A subtype, the human bladder contains predominantly the alpha 1D subtype while blood vessels express predominantly alpha 1B subtype. It is further believed that blockade of the alpha 1D subtypes in the human obstructed bladder may be responsible for reducing detrusor overactivity and subsequent relief of storage symptoms.Dutasteride: A synthetic 4-azasteriod compound is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both Type I and Type II 5 alpha-reductase isoenzymes that affects the static component of BPH by inhibiting the conversion of Testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase. 5 alpha-reductase exists as 2 isoforms, Type I and Type II, both of which are present in the prostate. It has been observed that compared to normal tissue, the expression of both isoenzymes are increased in BPH tissue. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride lowers DHT levels and leads to a reduction in prostatic volume, thereby treating an underlying cause of BPH. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults (including elderly): The recommended dose is one capsule (Tamsulosin Hydrochloride 0.4 mg & Dutasteride 0.5 mg) taken orally approximately 30 minutes after the same meal each day. The capsules should be swallowed whole and not chewed or opened. Where appropriate, this capsule may be used to substitute concomitant Tamsulosin Hydrochloride and Dutasteride in existing dual therapy to simplify treatment. Where clinically appropriate, direct change from Tamsulosin Hydrochloride or Dutasteride monotherapy to this capsule may be considered.Renal impairment: The effect of renal impairment on Tamsulosin-Dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. No adjustment in dosage is anticipated for patients with renal impairment.Hepatic impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on Tamsulosin-Dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied so caution should be used in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the use of this capsule is contra-indicated.",
    "Interaction": "There have been no drug interaction studies for Dutasteride-Tamsulosin combination. Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of Dutasteride: Use together with CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein-inhibitors: Dutasteride is mainly eliminated via metabolism. In vitro studies indicate that this metabolism is catalysed by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. No formal interaction studies have been performed with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, in a population pharmacokinetic study, Dutasteride serum concentrations were on average 1.6 to 1.8 times greater, respectively, in a small number of patients treated concurrently with verapamil or diltiazem (moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein) than in other patients. Long-term combination of Dutasteride with drugs that are potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP3A4 (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nefazodone, itraconazole, ketoconazole administered orally) may increase serum concentrations of Dutasteride. Further inhibition of 5-alpha reductase at increased Dutasteride exposure, is not likely. However, a reduction of the Dutasteride dosing frequency can be considered if side effects are noted. It should be noted that in the case of enzyme inhibition, the long half-life may be further prolonged and it can take more than 6 months of concurrent therapy before a new steady state is reached. Administration of 12 g cholestyramine one hour after a 5 mg single dose of Dutasteride did not affect the pharmacokinetics of Dutasteride. Effects of Dutasteride on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs: In a small study (N=24) of two weeks duration in healthy men, Dutasteride (0.5 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Tamsulosin or terazosin. There was also no indication of a pharmacodynamic interaction in this study. Dutasteride has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or digoxin. This indicates that Dutasteride does not inhibit/induce CYP2C9 or the transporter P-glycoprotein. In vitro interaction studies indicate that Dutasteride does not inhibit the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4. Tamsulosin: Concomitant administration of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride with drugs which can reduce blood pressure, including anaesthetic agents, PDE5 inhibitors and other alpha-1 adrenergic blockers could lead to enhanced hypotensive effects. Tamsulosin-Dutasteride should not be used in combination with other alpha-1 adrenergic blockers. Concomitant administration of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride (0.4 mg) and cimetidine (400 mg every six hours for six days) resulted in a decrease in the clearance (26%) and an increase in the AUC (44%) of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride. Caution should be used when Tamsulosin-Dutasteride is used in combination with cimetidine. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between Tamsulosin Hydrochloride and warfarin has not been conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and Tamsulosin Hydrochloride. No interactions have been seen when Tamsulosin Hydrochloride was given concomitantly with either atenolol, enalapril, nifedipine or theophylline. Concomitant furosemide brings about a fall in plasma levels of Tamsulosin, but as levels remain within the normal range posology need not be adjusted. In vitro neither diazepam nor propranolol, trichlormethiazide, chlormadinon, amitryptyline, diclofenac, glibenclamide and simvastatin change the free fraction of Tamsulosin in human plasma. Neither does Tamsulosin change the free fractions of diazepam, propranolol, trichlormethiazide, and chlormadinon. No interactions at the level of hepatic metabolism have been seen during in vitro studies with liver microsomal fractions, involving amitriptyline, salbutamol and glibenclamide. Diclofenac however, may increase the elimination rate of Tamsulosin.",
    "Contraindications": "Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination is contra-indicated in women and children and adolescents, patients with hypersensitivity to Dutasteride, other 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, Tamsulosin (including Tamsulosin- induced angio-edema), soya, peanut or any of other the excipients, patients with a history of orthostatic hypotension and patients with severe hepatic impairment.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving combination therapy were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), ejaculation disorders and dizziness. The percentages of subjects with ejaculation disorders, decreased libido and impotence were higher in the combination therapy group compared with either monotherapy groups.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination is contra-indicated for use by women. There have been no studies to investigate the effect of Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination on pregnancy, lactation and fertility. The following statements reflect the information available from studies with the individual components. Fertility: Dutasteride has been reported to affect semen characteristics (reduction in sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility) in healthy men. The possibility of reduced male fertility cannot be excluded. Effects of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride on sperm counts or sperm function have not been evaluated. Pregnancy: As with other 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and may, if administered to a woman carrying a male foetus, inhibit the development of the external genitalia of the foetus. Small amounts of Dutasteride have been recovered from the semen in subjects receiving Dutasteride. It is not known whether a male foetus will be adversely affected if his mother is exposed to the semen of a patient being treated with Dutasteride. As with all 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, when the patient\u2019s partner is or may potentially be pregnant it is recommended that the patient avoids exposure of his partner to semen by use of a condom. Administration of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride to pregnant female rats and rabbits showed no evidence of foetal harm. Lactation: It is not known whether Tamsulosin or Dutasteride are excreted in human milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Combination therapy should be prescribed after careful benefit risk assessment due to the potential increased risk of adverse events (including cardiac failure) and after consideration of alternative treatment options including monotherapies. Cardiac failure: In two 4-year clinical studies, the incidence of cardiac failure was higher among subjects taking the combination of Dutasteride and an alpha blocker, primarily Tamsulosin, than it was among subjects not taking the combination. In these two trials, the incidence of cardiac failure was low (1%) and variable between the studies. Effects on prostate specific antigen (PSA) and prostate cancer detection: Digital rectal examination, as well as other evaluations for prostate cancer or other conditions which can cause the same symptoms as BPH, must be performed on patients prior to initiating therapy with Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination and periodically thereafter. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration is an important component in the detection of prostate cancer. Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination causes a decrease in mean serum PSA levels by approximately 50%, after 6 months of treatment. Patients receiving Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination should have a new PSA baseline established after 6 months of treatment. It is recommended to monitor PSA values regularly thereafter. Any confirmed increase from lowest PSA level while on Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination may signal the presence of prostate cancer or noncompliance to therapy with Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination and should be carefully evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. In the interpretation of a PSA value for a patient taking Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination, previous PSA values while on Dutasteride treatment should be sought for comparison. Treatment with Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination does not interfere with the use of PSA as a tool to assist in the diagnosis of prostate cancer after a new baseline has been established. Total serum PSA levels return to baseline within 6 months of discontinuing treatment. The ratio of free to total PSA remains constant even under the influence of Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. Prostate cancer and high grade tumours: Results of one clinical study in men at increase risk of prostate cancer revealed a higher incidence of Gleason 8-10 prostate cancers in Dutasteride treated men compared to placebo. The relationship between Dutasteride and high grade prostate cancer is not clear. Men taking Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination should be regularly evaluated for prostate cancer risk including PSA testing. Renal impairment: The treatment of severely renally impaired patients (creatinine clearance of less than 10 ml/min) should be approached with caution as these patients have not been studied. Hypotension: Orthostatic- As with other alpha-blockers, a reduction in blood pressure can occur during treatment with Tamsulosin, as a result of which, rarely, syncope can occur. Patients beginning treatment with Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination should be cautioned to sit or lie down at the first signs of orthostatic hypotension (dizziness, weakness) until the symptoms have resolved. In order to minimize the potential for developing postural hypotension the patient should be haemodynamically stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating use of PDE5 inhibitors. Symptomatic: Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including Tamsulosin are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil). Alpha adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome: Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with Tamsulosin. IFIS may lead to increased procedural complications during the operation. The initiation of therapy with Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is therefore not recommended. Discontinuing Tamsulosin 1-2 weeks prior to cataract surgery is anecdotally considered helpful, but the benefit and duration of stopping therapy prior to cataract surgery has not yet been established. Leaking Capsule: Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin, therefore, women, children and adolescents must avoid contact with leaking capsules. If contact is made with leaking capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water. Hepatic impairment: Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination has not been studied in patients with liver disease. Caution should be used in the administration of Tamsulosin-Dutasteride combination to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Breast neoplasia: Breast cancer has been reported in men taking Dutasteride in clinical trials and during the post-marketing period. Physicians should instruct their patients to promptly report any changes in their breast tissue such as lumps or nipple discharge. Currently it is not clear if there is a causal relationship between the occurrence of male breast cancer and long term use of Dutasteride.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/1033/tapentadol-hydrochloride": {
    "name": "Tapentadol Hydrochloride",
    "generic_id": "1033",
    "Indications": "Tapentadol Hydrochloride tablet is indicated for the relief of moderate to severe acute pain in patients 18 years of age or older.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic. Although their clinical relevance is unclear, tapentadol is believed to have two main mechanisms of action. Tapentadol is a selective mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist: it binds to MOR with an affinity greater than or equal to ten-fold affinity compared to delta- and kappa-opioid receptors. Tapentadol also inhibits noradrenaline reuptake, thereby increasing noradrenaline levels and activating alpha-2 receptors to promote analgesia. Tapentadol is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor; however, this action does not contribute to its analgesic effect.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "As with many centrally-acting analgesic medications, the dosing regimen should be individualized according to the severity of pain being treated, the previous experience with similar drugs and the ability to monitor the patient.The dose is 50 mg, 75 mg, or 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours depending upon pain intensity. On the first day of dosing, the second dose may be administered as soon as one hour after the first dose, if adequate pain relief is not attained with the first dose. Subsequent dosing is 50 mg, 75 mg, or 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours and should be adjusted to maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable tolerability.Daily doses greater than 700 mg on the first day of therapy and 600 mg on subsequent days have not been studied and are not recommended.",
    "Interaction": "Increased risk of serotonin syndrome with other drugs that enhance monoaminergic neurotransmission (e.g. TCAs, triptans, SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). Enhanced sedative effect with benzodiazepines, barbiturates, antipsychotics, H1-antihistamines and other opioids. Increased potential for addiction with mixed \u03bc-opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. nalbuphine, pentazocine) or partial \u03bc-opioid agonists (e.g. buprenorphine). Increased systemic exposure with strong inhibitors of UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 isoenzymes. Decreased efficacy with strong enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital).",
    "Contraindications": "This drug is contraindicated in patients with impaired Pulmonary Function, It is also contraindicated in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercapnia in unmonitored settings or the absence of resuscitative equipment. This drug is contraindicated in any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.",
    "Side Effects": "The following treatment-emergent adverse events may happen: heart rate increased, heart rate decreased, visual disturbance, abdominal discomfort, impaired gastric emptying, irritability, edema, drug withdrawal syndrome, hypersensitivity, involuntary muscle contractions, sensation of heaviness, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, disturbance in attention, sedation, dysarthria, memory impairment, ataxia, presyncope, syncope, coordination abnormal, seizure, urticaria, blood pressure decreased etc.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This preparation should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Neonates whose mothers have been taking Tapentadol should be monitored for respiratory depression.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Tapentadol should be administered with caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia respiratory problems such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc. Besides this in case of patient with sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, central nervous system (CNS) depression should have to be cautious prior administration of Tapentadol. Patients receiving other mu-opioid agonist analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with Tapentadol may exhibit additive CNS depression.",

    "Dosage & Administration": "Apply a thin layer of Tapinarof cream to affected areas once daily. Wash hands after application, unless Tapisis cream is for treatment of the hands. Tapinarof cream is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy of Tapinarof cream have not been established in pediatric subjects with psoriasis under 18 years of age.",
    "Interaction": "No hazardous interactions have been reported with other medicines.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitive to any of its components.",
    "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 1%) in subjects treated with Tapisis cream were folliculitis, nasopharyngitis, contact dermatitis, headache, pruritus, and influenza.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: The available data on Tapinarof cream use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, subcutaneous administration of Tapinarof to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in no significant adverse effects at doses 268 and 16 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of major birth defects, loss, and other adverse outcomes.Lactation: No data are available regarding the presence of Tapinarof in human milk or the effects of Tapinarof on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Tapinarof was detected in rat offspring following subcutaneous administration to pregnant female rats which suggests that tapinarof was transferred into the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tapinarof cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tapinarof cream or from the underlying maternal condition.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "For external use only. Avoid use in eyes, oral or intravaginal use. If there is any unusual allergic reaction with the use of Tapinarof, then treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Topical Tazarotene blocks ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, which is associated with cell proliferation and hyperplasia. Tazarotene suppresses expression of MRP8, a marker of inflammation present in the epidermis of psoriasis patients at high levels. In human keratinocyte cultures, it inhibits cornified envelope formation, whose build-up is an element of the psoriatic scale. Tazarotene also induces the expression of a gene which may be a growth suppressor in human keratinocytes and which may inhibit epidermal hyperproliferation in treated plaques.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "For psoriasis: Apply once daily in the evening usually for up to twelve weeks. Use and dose must be determined by the doctor of children upto 12 years of age.For acne: Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer of Tazarotene cream once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affeted area.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant dermatologic medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of Tazarotene cream is begun. Topical steroid may be hazardous in psoriasis; careful patient supervision is important. Consider if infection spreads. Do not use near a naked flame.",
    "Contraindications": "Retinoids may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Tazarotene cream is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be warned to the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when Tazarotene cream is used.",
    "Side Effects": "Generally Tazarotene cream is well-tolerated .The most frequent adverse events related to treatment with Tazarotene are skin-related as for example pruritus, erythema, burning, irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, Tazarotene is a teratogenic substance. It is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Tazarotene is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Tazarotene cream should be applied only to the affected areas. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, and mouth. If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. Retinoid should not be used on eczematous skin, as they may cause severe irritation. Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of Tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity.",

    "Pharmacology": "Tedizolid Phosphate is a prodrug that is converted by phosphatases to Tedizolid, the microbiologically active moiety, following oral and intravenous administration. Following multiple once-daily oral or intravenous administration, steady-state concentrations are achieved within approximately three days with Tedizolid, accumulation of approximately 30% (Tedizolid half-life of approximately 12 hours). Peak plasma Tedizolid concentrations are achieved within approximately 3 hours following oral administration under fasting conditions. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 91% and no dosage adjustment is necessary between intravenous and oral administration. Protein binding of Tedizolid to human plasma proteins is approximately 70 to 90%. Other than Tedizolid Phosphate, which accounts for approximately 95% of the total radiocarbon AUC in plasma, there are no other significant circulating metabolites in humans. There was no degradation of Tedizolid in human liver microsomes indicating Tedizolid Phosphate is unlikely to be a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes. Following single oral administration of 14C-labeled Tedizolid Phosphate under fasted conditions, the majority of elimination occurred via the liver, with 82% of the radioactive dose recovered in feces and 18% in urine.",

Telbivudine is the unmodified \u03b2\u2013L enantiomer of the naturally occurring nucleoside, thymidine. It undergoes phosphorylation via interaction with cellular kinases to form the active metabolite, telbivudine 5'-triphosphate.Telbivudine 5'\u2013triphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine 5'\u2013triphosphate. This leads to the chain termination of DNA synthesis, thereby inhibiting viral replication.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Telmisartan is a non-peptide angiotensin-ll receptor antagonist. Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.",

Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of\u00a0electrolyte\u00a0reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary\u00a0potassium\u00a0loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these\u00a0diuretics.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons.Subsequently, benzodiazepines like temazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action",
    "Dosage & Administration": "While the recommended usual adult dose is 15 mg before retiring, 7.5 mg may be sufficient for some patients, and others may need 30 mg.

    "Precautions & Warnings": "Since the risk of the development of oversedation, dizziness, confusion, and/or ataxia increases substantially with larger doses of benzodiazepines in elderly and debilitated patients, 7.5 mg of temazepam is recommended as the initial dosage for such patients. Temazepam should be administered with caution in severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent depression; it should be recognized that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function and in patients with chronic pulmonary insufficiency. If temazepam is to be combined with other drugs having known hypnotic properties or CNS-depressant effects, consideration should be given to potential additive effects. The possibility of a synergistic effect exists with the co-administration of temazepam and diphenhydramine. One case of stillbirth at term has been reported 8 hours after a pregnant patient received temazepam and diphenhydramine. A cause and effect relationship has not yet been determined.",

    "generic_id": "1792",
    "Indications": "Tenecteplase is indicated in Acute phase of myocardial infarction (AMI).",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA. Tenecteplase binds to fibrin rich clots via the fibronectin finger-like domain and the Kringle 2 domain. The protease domain then cleaves the Arg/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "No formal interaction studies with Tenecteplase and medicinal products commonly administered in patients with AMI have been performed. Medicinal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding prior to, during or after Tenecteplase therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Active internal bleeding; history of cerebrovascular accident; intracranial or intraspinal surgery, or trauma within 2 months; intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm; known bleeding diathesis; and severe uncontrolled hypertension.",
    "Side Effects": "The most frequent adverse reaction associated with Tenecteplase is bleeding. If serious bleeding occurs, concomitant heparin and antiplatelet therapy should be discontinued. Death or permanent disability can occur in patients who experience stroke or serious bleeding episodes.For Tenecteplase-treated patients in ASSENT-2, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.9% and any stroke was 1.8%. The incidence of all strokes, including intracranial bleeding, increases with increasing age. Non-intracranial major bleeding and the need for blood transfusions were lower in patients treated with Tenecteplase.Types of major bleeding reported in 1% or more of the patients were hematoma (1.7%) and gastrointestinal tract (1%). Types of major bleeding reported in less than 1% of the patients were urinary tract, puncture site (including cardiac catheterization site), retroperitoneal, respiratory tract, and unspecified. Types of minor bleeding reported in 1% or more of the patients were hematoma (12.3%), urinary tract (3.7%), puncture site (including cardiac catheterization site) (3.6%), pharyngeal (3.1%), gastrointestinal tract (1.9%), epistaxis (1.5%), and unspecified (1.3%).The following adverse reactions have been reported among patients receiving tenecteplase in clinical trials. These reactions are frequent sequelae of the underlying disease, and the effect of tenecteplase on the incidence of these events is unknown. These events include cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, pulmonary edema, heart failure, cardiac arrest, recurrent myocardial ischemia, myocardial reinfarction, myocardial rupture, cardiac tamponade, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, mitral regurgitation, thrombosis, embolism, and electromechanical dissociation. These events can be life-threatening and may lead to death. Nausea and/or vomiting, hypotension, and fever have also been reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The benefit of treatment must be evaluated against the potential risks in case of myocardial infarction during pregnancy. It is not known if tenecteplase is excreted into breast milk. It is not known if Tenecteplase is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tenecteplase is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: Standard management of myocardial infarction should be implemented concomitantly with Tenecteplase treatment. Arterial and venous punctures should be minimized. Noncompressible arterial puncture must be avoided and internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures should be avoided to minimize bleeding from the noncompressible sites. In the event of serious bleeding, heparin and antiplatelet agents should be discontinued immediately. Heparin effects can be reversed by protamine.Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity, including urticarial / anaphylactic reactions, have been reported after administration of Tenecteplase (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, laryngeal edema, rash, and urticaria). Monitor patients treated with Tenecteplase during and for several hours after infusion. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, appropriate therapy should be initiated.",

    "Indications": "Tenofovir Alafenamide is a hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor and is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in adults with compensated liver disease.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tenofovir alafenamide is a phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir (2\u2019-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analog). Tenofovir alafenamide as a lipophilic cell-permeant compound enters primary hepatocytes by passive diffusion and by the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Tenofovir alafenamide is then converted to tenofovir through hydrolysis primarily by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in primary hepatocytes. Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the pharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HBV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HBV reverse transcriptase, which results in DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases that include mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3 and there is no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in cell culture.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Testing Prior to Initiation of Tenofovir alafenamide:\u00a0Prior to initiation of Tenofovir alafenamide, patients should be tested for HIV-1 infection. Tenofovir alafenamide alone should not be used in patients with HIV-1 infection.Recommended Dosage in Adults:\u00a0The recommended dosage of Tenofovir alafenamide is 25 mg (one tablet) taken orally once daily with food.Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment: No dosage adjustment of Tenofovir alafenamide is required in patients with estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 15 ml per minute or in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD; estimated creatinine clearance below 15 ml per minute) who are receiving chronic hemodialysis. On days of hemodialysis administer Tenofovir alafenamide after completion of hemodialysis treatment. Tenofovir alafenamide is not recommended in patients with ESRD who are not receiving chronic hemodialysis.Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment:\u00a0No dosage adjustment of Tenofovir alafenamide is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). Tenofovir alafenamide is not recommended in patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment.Pediatric Use:\u00a0Safety and effectiveness of Tenofovir alafenamide in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.Geriatric Use:\u00a0In clinical trials, Tenofovir alafenamide was administered to 89 subjects aged 65 and over. No clinically significant differences in safety or efficacy have been observed between elderly subjects and subjects between 18 and less than 65 years of age.",
    "Interaction": "Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tenofovir alafenamide:\u00a0Tenofovir alafenamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. Drugs that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in tenofovir alafenamide absorption. Drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide resulting in decreased plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Tenofovir alafenamide. Coadministration of Tenofovir alafenamide with other drugs that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may increase the absorption & plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide.Drugs Affecting Renal Function: Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Tenofovir alafenamide with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of tenofovir and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include but are not limited to acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin) and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs.",
    "Contraindications": "Not available",
    "Side Effects": "The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:\n\nLactic Acidosis/Severe\u00a0Hepatomegaly\u00a0with Steatosis\u00a0\nSevere Acute Exacerbation of\u00a0Hepatitis B\nNew Onset or Worsening of Renal Impairment\n\r\nThe most common side effects are headache, stomach pain, tiredness, cough, nausea, back pain",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy:\u00a0Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 660 exposures to TAF-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 520 exposed in the first trimester and over 130 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 4.2% (95% CI: 2.6% to 6.3%) and 3.0% (95% CI: 0.8% to 7.5%) following first and second/third trimester exposure, respectively, to TAF-containing regimens. Methodologic limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. The MACDP population is not disease-specific, evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area, and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks gestation.Lactation: It is not known whether Tenofovir alafenamide & its metabolites are present in human breast milk, affect human milk production or have effects on the breastfed infant. Tenofovir has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats and rhesus monkeys after administration of TDF. It is not known if tenofovir alafenamide can be present in animal milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tenofovir alafenamide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tenofovir alafenamide or from the underlying maternal condition.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B after Discontinuation of Treatment: Discontinuation of anti-hepatitis B therapy, including Tenofovir alafenamide may result in severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Patients who discontinue Tenofovir alafenamide should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate resumption of antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted.Risk of Development of HIV-1 Resistance in Patients Coinfected with HBV and HIV-1:\u00a0Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance Tenofovir alafenamide alone is not recommended for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The safety and efficacy of Tenofovir alafenamide have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. HIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with Tenofovir alafenamide and if positive, an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen that is recommended for patients coinfected with HIV-1 should be used.New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment:\u00a0Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT) and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with TAF-containing products; while most of these cases were characterized by potential confounders that may have contributed to the reported renal events, it is also possible these factors may have predisposed patients to tenofovir- related adverse events. Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions. Prior to or when initiating Tenofovir alafenamide and during treatment with Tenofovir alafenamide on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue Tenofovir alafenamide in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis:\u00a0Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis including fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) another prodrug of tenofovir alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with Tenofovir alafenamide should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).",

    "Side Effects": "As with any medicine, side effects are possible with Tenofovir. If side effects do occur, in most cases, they are minor and either require no treatment or can easily be treated by you or your healthcare provider. Headache, diarrhea, nausea, and weakness appear to be some of the most common side effects of Tenofovir. Other possible side effects include indigestion or heartburn, chest pain, and drowsiness. While most Tenofovir side effects are minor, there are a number of side effects that should be reported to your healthcare provider immediately, including high cholesterol or triglycerides, kidney problems, depression, and anxiety.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category B. No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tenofovir should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. The centers for disease control and prevention recommend that HIV-1-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1. Pediatric Use: For the treatment of HIV-1 in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with body weight greater than or equal to 35 kg: The dose is 245 mg Tenofovir tablet is once daily taken orally Geriatric Use: Clinical trials of Tenofovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, keeping in mind the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including Tenofovir, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Exacerbation of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment discontinuation of anti-HBV therapy, including Tenofovir, may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue Tenofovir should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. New onset or worsening renal impairment: Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemial), has been reported with the use of Tenofovir.Coadministration with other products: Tenofovir should not be used in combination with the fixed-dose combination products which contains Tenofovir. Tenofovir should not be administered in combination with adefovir disoproxil.Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV: Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance Tenofovir should only be used in HIV-1 and HBV coinfected patients as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen.

    "name": "Tenoxicam",
    "generic_id": "1041",
    "Indications": "Tenoxicam is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of the following painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system: \n\nRheumatoid arthritis.\nOsteoarthritis.\nArthrosis.\nAnkylosing spondylitis.\nExtra-articular disorders, e.g. tendinitis, bursitis, periarthritis of the shoulders (shoulder-hand syndrome) or hips, strains, and sprains.\nAcute gout.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tenoxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties and it also inhibits platelet aggregation. Tenoxicam inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. In-vitro tests of leukocyte peroxidase suggest that tenoxicam may act as a scavenger for active oxygen at the site of inflammation. Tenoxicam is a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human metalloproteinases (stromelysin and collagenase), which induce cartilage breakdown. These pharmacological effects explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefit of Tenoxicam in the treatment of painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Tenoxicam showed no mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic effects in animals. As with other prostaglandin inhibitors, renal and gastrointestinal effects, increased incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition were observed in animal safety studies.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "As in the case of other NSAIDs, salicylate displaces tenoxicam from protein-binding sites and increases clearance and volume of distribution of tenoxicam. Concurrent treatment with salicylate or other NSAIDs should be avoided because of increased risk of gastrointestinal undesirable reactions. The co-administration of some NSAIDs and methotrexate has been associated with reduced renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, higher plasma concentrations of methotrexate, and severe methotrexate toxicity. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Tenoxicam is administered concurrently with methotrexate. No clinically relevant interaction was found in the small number of patients receiving concomitant treatment with gold, penicillamine or probenecid. As Tenoxicam may decrease the renal clearance of lithium, their concomitant administration may lead to increased plasma levels and toxicity of lithium. The plasma levels of lithium should be closely monitored. As with NSAIDs in general, Tenoxicam should not be administered concurrently with K-sparing diuretics. There is a known interaction between these two classes of compounds, which may cause hyperkalemia and renal failure. No clinically significant interaction between Tenoxicam and furosemide was noted, but Tenoxicam attenuates the blood pressure-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. As known from other NSAIDs, Tenoxicam might attenuate the antihypertensive effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers and ACE-inhibitors. No interactions have been reported between NSAIDs and centrally-acting alpha agonists or calcium channel blockers. There was no clinically relevant interaction when Tenoxicam was administered together with atenolol. During clinical trials no interaction was reported for patients treated concomitantly with digitalis products. Thus concurrent dosing of Tenoxicam and digoxin appears to be without major risk. No interaction has been found with concomitantly administered antacids, cimetidine, warfarin and phenprocoumon at the recommended dosages. The clinical effect of oral antidiabetic drugs (glibornuride, glibenclamide, tolbutamide) was likewise not modified by Tenoxicam. Nevertheless, careful monitoring is recommended when patients concomitantly receive anticoagulants or oral antidiabetic drugs. No clinically relevant interaction has been found between Tenoxicam and low molecular weight heparin.",
    "Contraindications": "Tenoxicam must not be administered to patients: \n\nknown to be hypersensitive to the drug;\nin whom salicylates or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induce symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria;\nsuffering or having suffered from the disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer.",
    "Side Effects": "Based on clinical trials including large numbers of patients, Tenoxicam proved to be well tolerated in the recommended dose. Usually, the undesirable effects reported were mild and transient. In a small proportion of patients, the interruption of treatment due to undesirable effects was necessary. Local tolerance of Tenoxicam given parenterally was good. The following undesirable effects have been reported: Frequency is greater than 1%-\n\nGastrointestinal tract: gastric, epigastric and abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea.\nCentral nervous system: dizziness, headache.\n\r\nFrequency less than 1%-\n\nGastrointestinal tract: constipation, diarrhea, stomatitis, gastritis, vomiting, ulcers, Gl-bleeding including hematemesis and melena.\nCentral nervous system: fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite loss, dry mouth, vertigo.\nSkin: itching (also in the anal region after rectal administration), erythema, exanthema, rash, urticaria.\nUrinary tract and kidneys: increase in BUN or creatinine, edema.\nLiver and biliary tract: increased liver enzyme activity.\nCardiovascular system: palpitations.\n\r\nIsolated cases (frequency less than 0.01%)-\n\nGastrointestinal tract: Gl-perforation.\nCentral nervous system: visual disturbances.\nSkin: Stevens-Johnson and Lyell's syndrome, photosensitivity reaction, vasculitis.\nBlood: anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.\nHypersensitivity reactions: dyspnea, asthma, anaphylaxis, angioedema.\nCardiovascular system: elevated blood pressure, mainly in patients treated with cardiovascular drugs.\nLiver/Biliary tract: hepatitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "NSAIDs have an inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis and, when given during late pregnancy, may cause the closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus, prolong labor and delay parturition. Treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. Based on findings from single-dose administration, a very small amount (approximately 0.2%) of tenoxicam passes into breast milk. There is no evidence of adverse reactions in breast-fed infants of mothers taking Tenoxicam. Nevertheless, infants should be weaned or the drug discontinued.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "NSAIDs inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis and consequently may have an undesirable effect on renal hemodynamics and on salt and water balance. It is necessary to adequately monitor the patient with a special emphasis on cardiac and renal function (BUN, creatinine, development of edema, weight gain, etc.) when giving Tenoxicam to patients with conditions that could increase their risk of developing renal failure, such as pre-existing renal disease, impaired renal function in diabetics, hepatic cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, volume depletion or concomitant treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs, diuretics and corticosteroids. Tenoxicam inhibits platelet aggregation and may affect hemostasis. Tenoxicam has no significant influence on blood coagulation factors, coagulation time, prothrombin time or activated thromboplastin time. Patients having coagulation disorders or receiving drug therapy that interferes with hemostasis should, however, be carefully observed when Tenoxicam is administered. Any patient being treated with Tenoxicam who presents with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease should be closely monitored. If peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, Tenoxicam should be immediately withdrawn. If severe skin reactions (e.g. Lyell's or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) occur, the treatment should be discontinued immediately. Adverse eye findings have been reported with Tenoxicam. Thus ophthalmic evaluation is recommended for patients who develop visual disturbances. Because of the high plasma protein binding of tenoxicam, caution is required when plasma albumin levels are markedly reduced. In common with anti-inflammatory drugs, Tenoxicam may mask the usual signs of infection. Tenoxicam Tablets should not be given to patients who either dislike or do not tolerate milk products.",

    "Indications": "Terazosin Hydrochloride is indicated in-\n\nSingle therapy is used to relieve from signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\nFor the treatment of hypertension.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Terazosin is selective for alpha-1-adrenoceptors but not their individual subtypes. Inhibition of these alpha-1-adrenoceptors results in relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate, lowering blood pressure and improving urinary flow. Smooth muscle cells accounts for roughly 40% of the volume of the prostate and so their relaxation reduces pressure on the urethra.It has also been shown that catecholamines induce factors responsible for mitogenesis and alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit this effect. A final long term mechanism of terazosin and other alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers is the induction of apoptosis of prostate cells. Treatment with terazosin enhances the expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1), which upregulates p27kip1, and the caspase cascade",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia-\n\nInitial dose: 1 mg at bedtime is starting dose of all patients and this dose should not be exceeded.\nSubsequent dose: The dose slowly increases to achieve the desired response.

Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, angioedema and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis). Other adverse reactions that have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, and hair loss.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Terbinafine tablet: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and because treatment of onychomycosis can be postponed until after pregnancy is completed, it is recommended that terbinafine not be initiated during pregnancy. After oral administration, terbinafine is present in the breast milk of nursing mothers. Treatment with terbinafine is not recommended in nursing mothers. Terbinafine cream: Foetal toxicity and fertility studies in animals suggest no adverse effects. There is no clinical experience with terbinafine in pregnant women; therefore, unless the potential benefits outweigh any potential risk, terbinafine should not be administered. Terbinafine is excreted in breast milk and therefore mothers should not receive terbinafine treatment whilst breast-feeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Warnings-\n\nTerbinafine Hydrochloride tablets: Rare cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets for the treatment of onychomycosis in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions and an uncertain causal association with terbinafine. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if there is biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury. There have been isolated reports of serious skin reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine should be discontinued.\nTerbinafine cream: Terbinafine cream is for external use only. Contact with the eyes should be avoided.\n\nPrecautions: Terbinafine Hydrochloride are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Terbinafine, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Terbutaline is a relatively selective \u03b22-adrenergic bronchodilator that has little or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. The drug has exerts a preferential effect on \u03b22-adrenergic receptors but stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors less selectively than relatively selective \u03b22-agonists. Terbutaline appears to have a greater stimulating effect on beta-receptors of the bronchial, vascular, and uterine smooth muscles (\u03b22 receptors) than on the beta-receptors of the heart (\u03b21 receptors). This drug relaxes smooth muscle and inhibits uterine contractions, but may also cause some cardiostimulatory effects and CNS stimulation.The pharmacologic effects of terbutaline are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic- 3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "\u03b2-blocking agents, especially the non-selective ones such as propranolol may partially or totally inhibit the effect of \u03b2-stimulants. Therefore Terbutaline preparations and non-selective \u03b2-blockers should not normally be administered concurrently. Terbutaline should be used with caution in patients receiving other sympathomimetics.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to Terbutaline.",
    "Side Effects": "The frequency of side-effects is low at the recommended doses. Side-effects which have been recorded such as tremor, headache, tonic cramp and palpitations are all characteristic of sympathomimetic amines. A few patients feel tense; this is also due to the effects on skeletal muscle and not to direct CNS stimulation. Whenever these side-effects have occurred the majority have usually been spontaneously reversible within the first week of treatment. Urticaria and exanthema may occur. In children sleep disturbances and disturbances of behavioural effects have been observed. Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from \u03b22-agonist therapy.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Although no teratogenic effects have been observed in animals or in patients, Terbutaline should only be administered with caution during the first trimester of pregnancy. Terbutaline is secreted via breast milk, but effect on the infant is unlikely at therapeutic doses.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Care should be taken with patients suffering from myocardial insufficiency or thyrotoxicosis. Due to the hyperglycaemic effects of \u03b22-stimulants, additional blood glucose measurements are initially recommended when Terbutaline therapy is commenced in diabetic patients. If a previously effective dosage regimen no longer gives the same symptomatic relief the patient should seek further medical advice, for reassessment of asthma therapy, as soon as possible. Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from \u03b22-agonist therapy. Particular caution is advised in severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations. Due to the positive inotropic effect of \u03b22-agonists, these drugs should not be used in patients with hypertophic cardiomyopathy.",

    "Indications": "Teriparatide SC Injection is a parathyroid hormone analog, (PTH 1-34), indicated for:\n\nTreatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.\nIncrease of bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.\nTreatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy at high risk for fracture.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Endogenous 84-amino acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney. Teriparatide is not expected to accumulate in bone or other tissues. The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. In monkey studies, teriparatide improved trabecular microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength by stimulating new bone formation in both cancellous and cortical bone. In humans, the anabolic effects of teriparatide manifest as an increase in skeletal mass, an increase in markers of bone formation and resorption, and an increase in bone strength. By contrast, continuous excess of endogenous PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, may be detrimental to the skeleton because bone resorption may be stimulated more than bone formation.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "Digoxin: A single Teriparatide dose did not alter the effect of digoxin on the systolic time interval (from electrocardiographic Q-wave onset to aortic valve closure, a measure of digoxin\u2019s calcium-mediated cardiac effect). However, because Teriparatide may transiently increase serum calcium, Teriparatide should be used with caution in patients taking digoxinHydrochlorothiazide: The coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg with teriparatide did not affect the serum calcium response to teriparatide 40 mcg. The effect of coadministration of a higher dose of hydrochlorothiazide with teriparatide on serum calcium levels has not been studied Furosemide: Coadministration of intravenous furosemide (20 to 100 mg) with teriparatide 40 mcg in healthy people and patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (CrCl 13 to 72 mL/min) resulted in small increases in the serum calcium (2%) and 24-hour urine calcium (37%) responses to teriparatide that did not appear to be clinically important",

The standard average duration of treatment is 10 days.",
    "Interaction": "The hypotensive effect of non-selective beta-blockers on the portal vein is increased with terlipressin. Concomitant treatment with medicinal products with a known bradycardiac effect (e.g. propofol, sufentanil) may lower the heart rate and cardiac output. These effects are due to reflexofenic inhibition of the cardiac activity via the vagus nerve due to elevated blood pressure. Terlipressin can trigger \"torsade de pointes\". Therefore, extreme caution should be exercised in the use of terlipressin in patients with concomitant medications that can prolong the QT interval, such as class IA and III antiarrhythmics, erythromycin, certain antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants or medications that may cause hypokalaemia or hypomagnesemia (e.g. some diuretics).",

Testosterone are soft oval glossy capsules, transparent, orange-red colour, with an oily fill.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Testosterone plays a key role in male sexual differentiation and is involved in regulation of hematopoiesis, body composition, and bone metabolism. As a result, testosterone replacement therapy in males with hypogonadism can result in improved sexual function, increased lean body mass, bone density, erythropoiesis, prostate size, and changes in lipid profiles.Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells and exerts it's effects by binding to androgen receptors throughout the body. Testosterone affects the voice, genitalia, mood, and influences muscle growth and protein expression. Accordingly, males with low levels of testosterone often experience decreased libido, fatigue, mood changes and dysphoria. Exogenous sources of testosterone are designed to mimic the effects of endogenous testosterone.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "Food allows Testosterone Undecanoate to be taken up by your body. Therefore, Testosterone must be taken with a meal.

It is also indicated as maintenance therapy for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous manifestations of ENL recurrence.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Cellular activities of thalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex. Thalidomide possesses immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties. Available data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration. Other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of Thalidomide may include suppression of macrophage involvement in prostaglandin synthesis, and modulation of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma patients is accompanied by an increase in the number of circulating natural killer cells, and an increase in plasma levels of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. The cellular processes of angiogenesis inhibited by thalidomide may include the proliferation of endothelial cells.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Multiple Myeloma: The recommended dose of thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is 200 mg once daily (in 28-day treatment cycles) orally with water, preferably at bedtime and at least 1 hour after the evening meal.Erythema Nodosum Leprosum: The recommended dose of thalidomide for an episode of cutaneous ENL is 100 to 300 mg/day once daily orally with water, preferably at bedtime and at least 1 hour after the evening meal.Dosing for patients weighing less than 50 kilograms should be initiated at the low end of the dose range. Higher dosage range should be considered for patients with a severe cutaneous ENL reaction, or in those who have previously required higher doses to control the reaction (possibly up to 400 mg/day) once daily at bedtime or in divided doses with water, at least 1 hour after meals. Concomitant use of corticosteroids should be considered in patients with moderate to severe neuritis associated with a severe ENL reaction. Steroid usage can be tapered and discontinued when the neuritis has ameliorated. Higher dosage of Thalidomide should be continued until signs and symptoms of active reaction have subsided, usually a period of at least 2 weeks. Patients may then be tapered off medication in 50 mg decrements every 2 to 4 weeks.",
    "Interaction": "Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, or Other CNS Depressants (Including Alcohol): The use of opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, antianxiety agents, or other CNS depressants concomitantly with thalidomide may cause an additive sedative effect and should be avoided.Drugs which Cause Bradycardia: The use of drugs which slow cardiac conduction concomitantly with Thalidomide may cause an additive bradycardic effect and should be used with caution.Drugs that Interfere with Hormonal Contraceptives: Concomitant use of HIV-protease inhibitors, griseofulvin, modafinil, penicillins, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or certain herbal supplements such as St. John\u2019s Wort with hormonal contraceptive agents may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception up to one month after discontinuation of these concomitant therapies. Therefore, females requiring treatment with one or more of these drugs must use two other effective or highly effective methods of contraception while taking thalidomide.Drugs which Cause Peripheral Neuropathy: The use of drugs which cause peripheral neuropathy (e.g., bortezomib, amiodarone, cisplatin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, vincristine, disulfiram, phenytoin, metronidazole, alcohol) can cause an additive effect and should be used with caution.Concomitant Therapies that may Increase the Risk of Thromboembolism: Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thromboembolism, such as estrogen containing therapies, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving Thalidomide with dexamethasone.",
    "Contraindications": "Thalidomide is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Thalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Thalidomide is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.",
    "Side Effects": "The most frequently reported adverse reactions are fatigue, hypocalcemia, edema, constipation, sensory neuropathy, dyspnea, muscle weakness, leukopenia, neutropenia, rash/desquamation, confusion, anorexia, nausea, anxiety/agitation, tremor, fever, weight loss, thrombosis/ embolism, neuropathy-motor, weight gain, dizziness, and dry skin.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Based on the mechanism of action, human and animal data, thalidomide can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. If pregnancy does occur during treatment, the drug should be immediately discontinued.Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of thalidomide in human milk, the effects of thalidomide on the breastfed child, or the effects of thalidomide on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from thalidomide, women should be advised not to breastfeed during treatment with thalidomide.Females and Males of Reproductive Potential-Pregnancy Testing: Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating Thalidomide. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing Thalidomide. Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions, pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use, then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks.Contraception: Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously. Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with Thalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of Thalidomide therapy.Males: Thalidomide is present in the semen of males who take Thalidomide. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking Thalidomide, during dose interruptions and for up to 28 days after discontinuing Thalidomide.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Thalidomide is a powerful human teratogen that induces a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects, even after a single dose. Mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. When there is no satisfactory alternative treatment, females of reproductive potential may be treated with Thalidomide provided adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy. There are no specific data available regarding the reproductive risks of cutaneous absorption or inhalation of Thalidomide; however, females of reproductive potential should avoid contact with Thalidomide Capsules. If there is contact with non-intact Thalidomide capsules or the powder contents, the exposed area should be washed with soap and water. If healthcare providers or other care givers are exposed to body fluids from patients receiving Thalidomide, the exposed area should be washed with soap and water. Appropriate precautions should be utilized, such as wearing gloves to prevent the potential cutaneous exposure to Thalidomide.Blood Donation: Patients must not donate blood during treatment with Thalidomide and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug.Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism: The use of Thalidomide in patients with MM results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This risk increases significantly when Thalidomide is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered based on an assessment of individual patients' underlying risk factors. Patients and physicians should be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia, including Grade 3 or 4 occurrences, has been reported in association with the clinical use of thalidomide. Blood counts, including platelet counts should be monitored. Dose reduction, delay, or discontinuation may be required. Patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding including petechiae, epistaxis, and gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if concomitant medication may increase the risk of bleeding.Drowsiness and Somnolence: Thalidomide frequently causes drowsiness and somnolence. Patients should be instructed to avoid situations where drowsiness may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause drowsiness without adequate medical advice. Patients should be advised as to the possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating other complex or dangerous machinery. Dose reductions may be required.Peripheral Neuropathy: Thalidomide is known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent. Peripheral neuropathy is a common (>10%) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with Thalidomide that may be irreversible. Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months; however, peripheral neuropathy following relatively short-term use has been reported. Medications known to be associated with neuropathy should be used with caution in patients receiving Thalidomide.Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension: Patients should also be advised that Thalidomide may cause dizziness and orthostatic hypotension and that, therefore, they should sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position.Neutropenia: Decreased white blood cell counts, including neutropenia, have been reported in association with the clinical use of Thalidomide. Treatment should not be initiated with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <750/mm3. White blood cell count and differential should be monitored on an ongoing basis, especially in patients who may be more prone to neutropenia, such as patients who are HIVseropositive. If ANC decreases to below 750/mm3 while on treatment, the patient\u2019s medication regimen should be re-evaluated and, if the neutropenia persists, consideration should be given to withholding Thalidomide if clinically appropriate.",

    "Interaction": "Theophylline should not be used concurrently with other preparations containing xanthine derivatives. The clearance of theophylline is increased by barbiturates, carbamazepine, lithium, phenytoin, rifampicin and sulphinpyrazone and it may therefore be necessary to increase dosage. On the other hand, the clearance of the drug is reduced by allopurinol, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, corticosteroids, erythromycin, frusemide, isoprenaline, oral contraceptive and thiabendazole and a reduced dosage may therefore be needed to avoid side effects. Theophylline can potentiate hypokalemia resulting from beta-2-agonist therapy, steroids, diuretics and hypoxia, so serum potassium levels should be monitored in such instances.",
    "Contraindications": "Theophylline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Theophylline or any other component of the product.",
    "Side Effects": "Generally side effects are rare at normal dosage. It may include gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, insomnia and hypotension. CNS stimulation and diuresis may also occur, especially in children.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "It is not known whether Theophylline can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant woman. Xanthines should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Theophylline is excreted into breast milk and may cause irritability or other signs of mild toxicity in nursing human infants. Serious adverse effects in the infant are unlikely unless the mother has toxic serum Theophylline concentrations.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Careful consideration is needed for various interacting drugs and physiologic conditions that can alter Theophylline clearance. Dosage adjustment is required prior to initiation of Theophylline therapy, prior to increases in Theophylline dose, and during follow up.

    "name": "Thiamine Hydrochloride",
    "generic_id": "1063",
    "Indications": "Thiamine is specifically used in the treatment of the various manifestations of thiamine deficiency such as Beriberi and Wernick's encephalopathy, neuritis associated with pregnancy and pellagra. Supplementary Thiamine may be indicated prophylactically in conditions where there is low dietary intake or impaired gastro intestinal absorption of thiamine (e.g. alcohol) or where requirements are increased (pregnancy, carbohydrate rich diet).",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Thiamine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B1) is an essential constituent for the metabolism of carbohydrate and a lot of amino acids. Utilization of pyruvic acid and amino acid in tissue are decreased in Thiamine deficiency. So pyruvic acid and lactic acid are accumulated and cause Beri-beri. In adult, approximately 1 mg of Thiamine per day is completely degraded by the tissues, and this is roughly the minimal daily requirement. Thiamine is well absorbed from the Gastro-intestinal tract and is widely distributed to most body tissues. Excess of the body requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged or as metabolites.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "In the treatment of mild chronic Thiamine deficiency doses up to 30 mg daily in single or divided doses have been recommended. In severe Thiamine deficiency doses up to 300 mg daily have been given.",
    "Interaction": "Thiamine has no known severe interactions with other drugs.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to Thiamine.",
    "Side Effects": "No untoward effects occur when Thiamine is administered orally in amounts many times greater than the therapeutic dose.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The drug may be given safely to neonates, children, pregnant and lactating women and elderly patients.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "A very serious allergic reaction to this vitamin is rare.

    "Pharmacology": "Thiopental, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Thiopental is an ultrashort-acting depressant of the central nervous system which induces hypnosis and anesthesia, but not analgesia. It produces hypnosis within 30 to 40 seconds of intravenous injection. Recovery after a small dose is rapid, with some somnolence and retrograde amnesia. Repeated intravenous doses lead to prolonged anesthesia because fatty tissues act as a reservoir; they accumulate Pentothal in concentrations 6 to 12 times greater than the plasma concentration, and then release the drug slowly to cause prolonged anesthesiaThiopental binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl-\u00a0ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl-\u00a0ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Thiopental Injection is administered intravenously normally as a 2.5% w/v solution. On occasions it may be administered as a 5% w/v solution (500 mg in 10 ml). The intravenous injection preparation should be used after reconstitution of the sterile powder with Water for Injections, usually to produce a 2.5% w/v solution.Premedication: Premedication usually consists of atropine or scopolamine to suppress vagal reflexes and inhibit secretions. In addition, a barbiturate or an opiate is often given. Ideally, the peak effect of these medications should be reached shortly before the time of induction.Test dose: It is advisable to inject a small \"test\" dose of 25 mg to 75 mg of Thiopental Sodium for Injection to assess tolerance or unusual sensitivity to Thiopental Sodium for Injection, and pausing to observe patient reaction for at least 60 seconds. If unexpectedly deep anesthesia develops or if respiratory depression occurs, consider these possibilities: (1) the patient may be unusually sensitive to Thiopental Sodium for Injection, (2) the solution may be more concentrated than had been assumed, or (3) the patient may have received too much.Use in anaesthesia: Normal dosage for the induction of anesthesia is 100 mg to 150 mg injected over 10 to 15 seconds. If necessary, a repeat dose of 100 mg to 150 mg may be given after one minute. No fixed dosage recommendations for the intravenous injection can be given, since the dosage will need to be carefully adjusted according to the patient's response. Factors such as age, sex, and weight of the patient should be taken into consideration. Thiopental Sodium reaches effective concentrations in the brain within 30 seconds and anesthesia is normally produced within one minute of an intravenous dose.\n\nAdult: 100 mg to 150 mg intravenously over 10 to 15 seconds, normally as a 2.5% w/v solution. A repeat dose of 100 mg to 150 mg may be given after one minute. The intravenous injection should be given slowly and the amount given titrated against the patient's response to minimize the risk of respiratory depression or the possibility of over dosage. The average dose for an adult of 70 kg is roughly 200 mg to 300 mg (8 mls to 12 mls of a 2.5% w/v solution) with a maximum of 500 mg.\nChildren: 2 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg bodyweight, intravenously over 10 to 15 seconds, normally as a 2.5% w/v solution. A repeat dose of 2 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg may be given after one minute. The dose is 2 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg based on the patient's response. The dose for children should not exceed 7 mg/kg.\nElderly: Smaller adult doses are advisable.\n\nUse in convulsive states: 75 mg to 125 mg (3 mls to 5 mls of a 2.5% w/v solution) should be given as soon as possible after the convulsion begins. Further doses may be required to control convulsion following the use of a local anesthetic. Other regimens, such as the use of intravenous or rectal diazepam, may be used to control convulsive states.",
    "Interaction": "Possible increase in difficulty in producing anaesthesia in patients taking alcohol or CNS depressants. Additive action with other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, nitrous oxide or alcohol. Increased hypotension and excitatory effects with phenothiazine antipsychotics. Increased hypnotic effect with antipsychotic. Decreased requirement of thiopental sodium with metoclopramide, sulfisoxazole, aspirin, meprobamate, probenecid and other highly protein bound drugs.",

Other adverse reactions to thiopental sodium include the followings: respiratory depression, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged somnolence and recovery, hypotension, tachycardia, sneezing, coughing, bronchospasm, laryngospasm and shivering. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Symptoms, e.g., urticaria, bronchospasm, vasodilation and edema.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Thiopental. It is also not known whether Thiopental can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Thiopental should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Thiopental sodium readily crosses the placental barrier and small amounts may appear in the milk of nursing mothers following administration of large doses.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "A person competent in anesthesia management should be in constant attendance and adequate facilities for support of respiration and circulation should be available when Thiopental Sodium for injection is being used. Thiopental Sodium for Injection should be administered with caution to patients with preexisting hypotension or in conditions where the hypnotic effect may be prolonged or intensified, such as in the presence of liver disease and renal disease. This product may be habit forming. Keep resuscitative and endotracheal intubation equipment and oxygen readily available. Maintain patency of the airway at all times. Only persons qualified in the use of anesthetics should administer this drug. Avoid extravasations or intra-arterial injection.",

    "Interaction": "Live virus and bacterial vaccines must not be administered to a patient receiving an immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent and at least three months must elapse between discontinuation of therapy and vaccination.Thiotepa appears to be metabolised via CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Co-administration with inhibitors of CYP2B6 (for example clopidogrel and ticlopidine) or CYP3A4 (for example azole antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, and protease inhibitors) may increase the plasma concentrations of thiotepa and potentially decrease the concentrations of the active metabolite TEPA. Co-administration of inducers of cytochrome P450 (such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) may increase the metabolism of thiotepa leading to increased plasma concentrations of the active metabolite. Therefore, during the concomitant use of thiotepa and these medicinal products, patients should be carefully monitored clinically.Thiotepa is a weak inhibitor for CYP2B6, and may thereby potentially increase plasma concentrations of substances metabolised via CYP2B6, such as ifosfamide, tamoxifen, bupropion, efavirenz and cyclophosphamide. CYP2B6 catalyzes the metabolic conversion of cyclophosphamide to its active form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-OHCP) and co-administration of thiotepa may therefore lead to decreased concentrations of the active 4 OHCP. Therefore, a clinical monitoring should be exercised during the concomitant use of thiotepa and these medicinal products.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance. Pregnancy and lactation. Concomitant use with yellow fever vaccine and with live virus and bacterial vaccines.",
    "Side Effects": "Not available",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no data on the use of thiotepa during pregnancy. In pre-clinical studies thiotepa, as most alkylating agents, has been shown to cause embryofoetal lethality and teratogenicity. Therefore, thiotepa is contraindicated during pregnancy. It is unknown whether thiotepa is excreted in human milk. Due to its pharmacological properties and its potential toxicity for breast-fed newborns/infants, breastfeeding is contraindicated during treatment with thiotepa.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The consequence of treatment with thiotepa at the recommended dose and schedule is profound myelosuppression, occurring in all patients. Severe granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia or any combination thereof may develop. Frequent complete blood counts, including differential white blood cell counts, and platelet counts need to be performed during the treatment and until recovery is achieved. Platelet and red blood cell support, as well as the use of growth factors such as Granulocyte- colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), should be employed as medically indicated. Daily white blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended during therapy with thiotepa and after transplant for at least 30 days.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tibolone is a synthetic steroid that has estrogenic, androgenic and progestagenic properties. After oral administration, Tibolone is rapidly metabolized into three compounds which contribute to the pharmacological effects of Tibolone. Two of these metabolites (the 3\u03b1\u2212OH and 3\u03b2\u2212OH metabolite) have predominantly estrogenic activity; a third metabolite (\u03b44-isomer of Tibolone) and the parent compound have predominantly progestagenic and androgenic activities. Tibolone substitutes for the loss of estrogen production in postmenopausal women and alleviates menopausal symptoms. It prevents bone loss following menopause or ovariectomy. It has estrogenic effects on the vagina, on bone and on the thermoregulatory centers in the brain (hot flushes). It improves vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy. Tibolone has also effects on mood and libido.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The dose is one Tibolone tablet per day (2.5 mg daily). The tablet should be swallowed with some water or other drink, preferably at the same time in each day. Improvement of symptoms generally occurs within a few weeks, but optimal results are obtained when therapy is continued for at least 3 months.Starting Tibolone Tablet: Women experiencing a natural menopause should commence treatment with Tibolone tablet at least 12 months after their last natural bleed. In case of a surgical menopause, treatment with Tibolone tablet may commence immediately.Switching from a sequential or continuous combined HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) preparation: If changing from a sequential HRT preparation, treatment with Tibolone should start the day following completion of the prior regimen. If changing from a continuous-combined HRT preparation, treatment can start at any time. Missed dose: A missed dose should be taken as soon as remembered, unless it is more than 12 hours overdue. In the later case, the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at the normal time. Missing a dose may increase the likelihood of breakthrough bleeding and spotting",
    "Interaction": "No examples of interactions between Tibolone and other medicines have been reported in clinical practice. However, the following potential interactions should be considered on a theoretical basis: Enzyme-inducing compounds such as barbiturates, carbamazepine, hydantoins, and rifampicin may enhance the metabolism of Tibolone and thus decrease its therapeutic effect. Since Tibolone may increase blood or fibrinolytic activity (lower fibrinogen levels; higher AT III, plasminogen, and fibrinolytic activity values), it may enhance the effect of anticoagulants.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, known or suspected hormone-dependent tumours, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disorders, active deep vein thrombosis, thromboembolic disorders, vaginal bleeding of unknown etiology and severe liver disorders.",
    "Side Effects": "Occasionally, vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur, mainly during the first months of treatment. Other adverse effects are headache and migraine, oedema, dizziness, pruritus, increase in body weight, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, and depression.",

    "name": "Ticagrelor",
    "generic_id": "1068",
    "Indications": "Ticagrelor, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. The P2Y12 receptor couples with G\u03b1i2 and other Gi proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Gi mediated signalling also activates PI3K, Akt, Rap1b, and potassium channels. The downstream effects of these activities mediate hemostasis and lead to platelet aggregation. Antagonism of the P2Y12 receptor reduces development of occlusive thromboses, which can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Patients taking Ticagrelor should also take a daily low maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75-150 mg unless specifically contraindicated. Acute coronary syndromes: Ticagrelor treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and then continued at 90 mg twice daily. Treatment with Ticagrelor twice daily is recommended for 12 months in ACS patients unless discontinuation is clinically indicated. History of myocardial infarction: Ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily is the recommended dose when an extended treatment is required for patients with a history of MI of at least one year and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment may be started without interruption as continuation therapy after the initial one-year treatment with ticagrelor or another adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor therapy in ACS patients with a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment can also be initiated up to 2 years from the MI, or within one year after stopping previous ADP receptor inhibitor treatment. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond 3 years of extended treatment. Switch therapy: If a switch is needed, the first dose of ticagrelor should be administered 24 hours following the last dose of the other antiplatelet medication. Missed dose: A patient who misses a dose of ticagrelor should take only one tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time. Elderly: No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. No information is available concerning the treatment of patients on renal dialysis and therefore ticagrelor is not recommended in these patients. Hepatic impairment: Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use in these patients is therefore contraindicated. Only limited information is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment is not recommended, but ticagrelor should be used with caution. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Pediatric population: The safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in hildren below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available. Ticagrelor can be administered with or without food. Contra-indications, warnings etc.",
    "Interaction": "Effects of medicinal and other products on ticagrelor; CYP3A4 inhibitors: Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir) inhibitors with ticagrelor is contraindicated. CYP3A inducers: Co-administration of ticagrelor with potent CYP3A inducers (rifampicin)may decrease exposure and efficacy of ticagrelor, therefore, their concomitant use with ticagrelor is discouraged. Cyclosporine (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor): No data are available on concomitant use of ticagrelor with other active substances that also are potent P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, quinidine) that also may increase ticagrelor exposure. If the association cannot be avoided, their concomitant use should be made with caution. Effects of ticagrelor on other medicinal products: Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4: The concomitant use of ticagrelor with doses of simvastatin or lovastatin greater than 40 mg is not recommended. Atorvastatin: Co-administration of atorvastatin and ticagrelor increased atorvastatin acid Cmax by 23% and AUC by 36%. Similar increases in AUC and Cmax were observed for all atorvastatin acid metabolites. These increases are not considered clinically significant. Ticagrelor is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of ticagrelor and CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (i.e. cisapride or ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as ticagrelor may increase the exposure to this medicinal products. P-gp substrates (including digoxin, cyclosporine): Appropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring is recommended when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent medicinal products like digoxin concomitantly with ticagrelor. Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9: Co-administration of ticagrelor with tolbutamide resulted in no change in the plasma levels of either medicinal product, which suggests that ticagrelor is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor and unlikely to alter the CYP2C9 mediated metabolism of medicinal products like warfarin and tolbutamide. Oral contraceptives: No clinically relevant effect on oral contraceptive efficacy is expected when levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is co-administered with ticagrelor. Medicinal products known to induce bradycardia: No evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions were observed in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more medicinal products known to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil, and 4% digoxin). Other concomitant therapy: No evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions with these medicinal products (acetylsalicylic acid, proton pump inhibitors, statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) was observed. Due to potential pharmacodynamic interactions, caution should be exercised with the concomitant administration of ticagrelor with medicinal products (heparin, enoxaparin or desmopressin) known to alter haemostasis. Due to reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities with SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram), caution is advised when administering SSRIs with ticagrelor as this may increase the risk of bleeding.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, active pathological bleeding, history of intracranial haemorrhage, severe hepatic impairment.",
    "Side Effects": "Very Common: Blood disorder bleedings, Hyperuricaemia, Dyspnoea. Common: Gout/Gouty Arthritis, Dizziness, Syncope, Headache, Vertigo, Hypotension, Respiratory system bleedings, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Dyspepsia, Constipation, Subcutaneous or dermal bleeding, Rash, Pruritus, Urinary tract bleeding, Blood creatinine increased, Postprocedural haemorrhage, Traumatic bleedings. Uncommon: Tumour bleedings, Hypersensitivity including angioedema, Confusion, Intracranial haemorrhage, Eye haemorrhage, Ear haemorrhage, Retroperitoneal haemorrhage, Muscular bleedings.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Ticagrelor is not recommended during pregnancy. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ticagrelor and its active metabolites in milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

    "Precautions & Warnings": "Bleeding risk: The use of ticagrelor in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. If clinically indicated, ticagrelor should be used with caution in the following patient groups; Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation disorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). Antifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa therapy may increase haemostasis. Ticagrelor may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been identified and controlled.Surgery: Patients should be advised to inform\u00a0 physicians and dentists that they are taking ticagrelor before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and the antiplatelet effect is not desired, ticagrelor should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery.Patients with prior ischaemic stroke: ACS patients with prior ischaemic stroke can be treated with ticagrelor for up to 12 months. Patients at risk for bradycardic events: Due to the limited clinical experience, ticagrelor should be used with caution in these patients.Dyspnoea: Patients with asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have an increased absolute risk of experiencing dyspnoea with ticagrelor. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients with a history of asthma and/or COPD. Creatinine elevations: Creatinine levels may increase during treatment with ticagrelor. In patients with ACS, it is recommended that renal function is also checked one month after initiating the treatment with ticagrelor, paying special attention to patients \u226575 years, patients with moderate/severe renal impairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Uric acid increase: Hyperuricaemia may occur during treatment with ticagrelor. Caution is advised in patients with a history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. Other: Based on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and relative efficacy of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of ticagrelor and high maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (>300 mg) is not recommended.Premature discontinuation: Premature discontinuation with any antiplatelet therapy, including ticagrelor, could result in an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death or MI due to the patient\u2019s underlying disease. Therefore, premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.",

This prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. Tigecycline carries a glycylamido moiety attached to the 9-position of minocycline. The substitution pattern is not present in any naturally occurring or semisynthetic tetracycline and imparts certain microbiologic properties to tigecycline. Tigecycline is not affected by the two major tetracycline resistance mechanisms, ribosomal protection and efflux. Accordingly, tigecycline has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. There has been no cross resistance observed between tigecycline and other antibiotics. Tigecycline is not affected by resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamases (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), target site modifications, macrolide efflux pumps or enzyme target changes (e.g. gyrase/topoisomerase). In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between tigecycline and other commonly used antibacterial drugs. In general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic.",

    "Indications": "Tirzepatide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Limitations of use:\n\nIt has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\nIt is not indicated for use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tirzepatide is a GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is a 39-amino-acid modified peptide with a C20 fatty diacid moiety that enables albumin binding and prolongs the half-life. It selectively binds to and activates both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, the targets for native GIP and GLP-1. It enhances first and second-phase insulin secretion and reduces glucagon levels, both in a glucose dependent manner.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Route of administration: Tirzepatide should be administered as a subcutaneous injection.Dosing instructions-\n\nThe recommended starting dosage is 2.5 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly. The 2.5 mg dosage is for treatment initiation and is not intended for glycemic control.\nAfter 4 weeks, increase the dosage to 5 mg once weekly. If additional glycemic control is needed, increase the dosage in 2.5 mg increments after at least 4 weeks on the current dose. The maximum dosage is 15 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly.\nIf a dose is missed, instruct patients to administer it as soon as possible within 4 days (96 hours) after the missed dose. If more than 4 days have passed, skip the missed dose and administer the next dose on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule.\nThe day of weekly administration can be changed, if necessary, as long as the time between the two doses is at least 3 days (72 hours).\n\nPreparation and administration-\n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions.\nDo not freeze. Do not use Tirzepatide that has been frozen.\nProtect pre-filled syringes from light.\nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use any pre-filled syringes exhibiting particulate matter and discoloration.\nHandle it carefully. If the pre-filled syringe dropped on a hard surface, do not use it.\nDo not dilute Tirzepatide and do not administer in conjunction with other drug solutions.\n\nAdministration instructions-\n\nAdminister once weekly, any time of day, with or without meals.\nInject it subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. Rotate injection sites with each dose. When using with insulin, administer as separate injections and never mix. It is acceptable to inject Tirzepatide and insulin in the same body region, but the injections should not be adjacent to each other.",
    "Interaction": "Drug interaction with medication: Consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Monitor patients on oral medications dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy and those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin) when concomitantly administered. Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with it. Hormonal contraceptives that are not administered orally should not be affected.",
    "Contraindications": "Tirzepatide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tirzepatide or any other components of this product. It is also contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia and abdominal pain.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy. Tirzepatide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tirzepatide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tirzepatide or from the underlying maternal condition.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of tirzepatide and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors. After initiation, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue tirzepatide and initiate appropriate management. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of tirzepatide; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses in patients with renal impairment reporting severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "GLP-1 receptor agonists",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep out of the reach and sight of children. Store in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. Do not freeze and protect from light. Do not use if it has been frozen. To be taken and sold only on the prescription of a registered physician."

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/1088/tizanidine-hydrochloride": {
    "name": "Tizanidine Hydrochloride",
    "generic_id": "1088",
    "Indications": "Tizanidine is indicated for the treatment of painful muscle spasms:\n\nAssociated with static and functional disorders of the spine (cervical and lumbar syndromes).\nFollowing surgery, e.g. for herniated intervertebral disc or osteoarthritis of the hip.\n\r\nTizanidine is indicated for the treatment of spasticity due to neurological disorders:\n\nMultiple sclerosis, chronic myelopathy, degenerative spinal cord diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, and cerebral palsy.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tizanidine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant. Its principal site of action is the spinal cord, where the evidence suggests that, by stimulating presynaptic alpha2 receptors, it inhibits the release of excitatory amino acids that stimulate N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) receptors.Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect.Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Tizanidine has a narrow therapeutic index and high inter-patient variability in tizanidine plasma concentrations which requires individualized dose adjustment. A low starting dose of 2 mg three times daily can minimize the risk for adverse effects. The dose should be carefully adjusted upward according to the needs of the individual patient.Relief of painful muscle spasms: The usual dose is 2 to 4 mg three times daily in tablet form. In severe cases, an extra dose of 2 or 4 mg may be taken, preferably at night to minimize sedation.Spasticity due to neurological disorders: The initial daily dose should not exceed 6 mg given in 3 divided doses. It may be increased stepwise at half-weekly or weekly intervals by 2 to 4 mg. The optimum therapeutic response is generally achieved with a daily dose of between 12 and 24 mg, administered in 3 or 4 equally spaced doses. The daily dose of 36 mg should not be exceeded.Pediatrics patients: Experience in patients below 18 years of age is limited and the use of Tizanidine in this population is not recommended.Geriatric patients (65 years of age or older): Experience with the use of Tizanidine in the elderly is limited. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at the lowest dose and increases should be done in small steps according to tolerability and efficacy.Renal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily. An increase in dosage should be done in small steps according to tolerability and efficacy. If efficacy has to be improved, it is advisable to first increase the strength of the daily dose before increasing the frequency of administration.Hepatic impairment: Use of Tizanidine in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated. While Tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, limited data are available in this population. Its use has been associated with a reversible abnormality in liver function tests. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and treatment should be started with the lowest dose. Afterward, an increase in dosage should be done carefully and according to patient tolerability.Discontinuation of treatment: If Tizanidine has to be discontinued, the dosage should be slowly down titrated, particularly in patients who have received high doses for a longer period of time to avoid or minimize the risk of rebound hypertension and tachycardia.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant administration of drugs known to inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 may increase the plasma levels of tizanidine. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation. Concomitant administration of drugs known to induce the activity of CYP1A2 may decrease the plasma levels of tizanidine. The decreased plasma levels of tizanidine may reduce the therapeutic effect of Tizanidine.Observed interactions resulting in a contraindication: Concomitant use of Tizanidine with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Concomitant use of Tizanidine with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin resulted in a 33-fold and 10-fold increase in tizanldine AUC, respectively. Clinically significant and prolonged hypotension may result along with somnolence, dizziness and decreased psychomotor performance. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation.Observed interactions resulting in concomitant use not recommended: Co administration of Tizanidine with other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, fluoroquinolones (enoxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin), rofecoxib, oral contraceptives, and ticlopidine is not recommended.Observed interactions to be considered: Caution should be exercised when Tizanidine is given with drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to cisapride, amytriptyline and azithromycin). Antihypertensives: Concomitant use of Tizanidine with antihypertensives, including diuretics, may occasionally cause hypotension and bradycardia. In some patients rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed upon abrupt discontinuation of Tizanidine when concomitantly used with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident.Rifampicin: Concomitant administration of Tizanidine with rifampicin results in 50% decrease in tizanidine concentrations. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of Tizanidine may be reduced during treatment with rifampicin, which may be of clinical significance in some patients. Long term coadministration should be avoided and if co- administration is considered a careful dose adjustment (increase) may be required.\u00a0Cigarette smoke: Administration of Tizanidine in smokers (>10 cigarettes per day) results in about 30% decrease in tizanidine systemic exposure. Long-term therapy with Tizanidine in heavy smokers may require higher doses than the average doses.Alcohol: While on Tizanidine therapy, alcohol consumption should be minimized or avoided as it may increase the potential for adverse events (e.g. sedation and hypotension). The central nervous system depressant effects of alcohol may be enhanced by Tizanidine.Anticipated interactions to be considered: Sedatives, hypnotics (e.g. benzodiazepine or baclofen), and another drug such as antihistamines may enhance the sedative action of tizanidine. Tizanidine should be avoided when using with other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (such as clonidine) because of their potential additive hypotensive effect.",
    "Contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to tizanidine or to any of the excipients.\nSeverely impaired hepatic function.\nConcomitant use of tizanidine with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is contraindicated.",
    "Side Effects": "With low doses, such as those recommended for the relief of painful muscle spasms, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, dry mouth, blood pressure decrease, nausea, gastrointestinal disorder and transaminase increase have been reported, usually as mild and transient adverse reactions.With the higher doses recommended for the treatment of spasticity, the adverse reactions reported with low doses are more frequent and more pronounced, but seldom severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. In addition, the following adverse reactions may occur: hypotension, bradycardia, muscular weakness, insomnia, sleep disorder, hallucination & hepatitis.\n\nPsychiatric disorders: Common- Insomnia, sleep disorder.\nNervous system disorders: Very common- Somnolence, dizziness\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon- Bradycardia\nVascular disorders: Common- Hypotension\nGastrointestinal disorders: Very common- Gastrointestinal disorder, dry mouth; Common- Nausea.\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Very common- Muscular weakness\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Very common- Fatigue\nInvestigations: Common- Blood pressure decreased, transaminases increased.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "As there is limited experience with the use of Tizanidine in pregnant women, it should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.Animal data: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, dose levels of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day increased gestation duration. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and development retardation occurred. At these doses, dams showed marked signs of muscle relaxation and sedation. Based on body surface area, these doses were 2.2 and 6.7 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg/day.Lactation: Small amounts of tizanidine are excreted in rat milk. Since no human (fata are available Tizanidine should not be given to women who are breast-feeding. Females and males of reproductive potential: Pregnancy testing:\u00a0 Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Tizanidine.Contraception: Females of reproductive potential should be advised that animal studies have been performed showing Tizanidine to be harmful to the developing fetus. Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1 % pregnancy rates) when using Tizanidine during treatment and for 1 day after stopping treatment with Tizanidine.Fertility: Animal data: No impairment of fertility was observed in male rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, and in female rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day. Fertility was reduced in male rats receiving 30 mg/kg/day and in female rats receiving 10 mg/kg/day. Based on body surface area, these doses were 6.7 and 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg. At these doses, maternal behavioral effects and clinical signs were observed including marked sedation, weight loss and ataxia.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "CYP inhibitors: The concomitant use of Tizanidine with moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors is not recommended. Caution should be exercised when Tizanidine is given with drugs known to increase the QT interval.Hypotension: Hypotension may occur during treatment with Tizanidine and also as a result of drug interactions with CYP1A2 inhibitors and/or antihypertensive drugs. Severe manifestations of hypotension such as loss of consciousness and circulatory collapse have also been observed.Withdrawal syndrome: Rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed after sudden withdrawal of Tizanidine, when it had been used chronically, and/or in high daily dosages, and/or concomitantly with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident. Tizanidine should not be stopped abruptly, but rather gradually down titrated.Hepatic dysfunction: Since hepatic dysfunction has been reported in association with tizanidine, but rarely at daily doses up to 12 mg, it is recommended that liver function tests should be monitored monthly for the first four months in patients receiving doses of 12 mg and higher and in patients who develop clinical symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, anorexia or tiredness. Treatment with Tizanidine should be discontinued if serum levels of SGPT or SGOT are persistently above three times the upper limit of the normal range.Patients with renal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) systemic exposure to tizanidine may increase up to 6 times compared to patient with normal renal function. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily.Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dermatitis, rash, urticarial, pruritis and erythema have been reported in association with tizanidine. Careful observation of the patient is recommended for one to two days after the first dose is administered. If anaphylaxis or angioedema with anaphylactic shock or difficulty of breathing is observed treatment with Tizanidine should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical treatment should be instituted.Driving and using machines: Patients experiencing somnolence, dizziness or any signs or symptoms of hypotension should refrain from activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g. driving a vehicle or operating machines.",

    "Pharmacology": "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by a dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL7, IL15, IL21, IL6, IFN-alpha, and IFN-beta. (3) Cytokines signalling results in tissue inflammation and joint damage by stimulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells via the janus kinase signalling pathway.Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may also achieve efficacy via other pathways as well.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "A seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures.The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors.Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.",

The usual total daily dose is 200 mg to 400 mg in two divided doses. Some patients may require doses up to 800 mg per day, which is the maximum recommended dose.\nChildren aged 2-16 years: The recommended total daily dose of Topiramate as adjunctive therapy is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. Daily doses up to 30 mg/kg/day have been studied and were generally well tolerated.\n\r\nMigraine: \n\nAdults and children over 16 years: Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for 1-week. The dosage should then be increased in increments of 25 mg/day administered at 1-week intervals. The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as treatment for the prophylaxis of migraine headache is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses. Some patients may experience a benefit at a total daily dose of 50 mg/day.\nChildren: Topiramate in migraine prophylaxis has not been studied in children under 16 years.",
    "Interaction": "The addition of topiramate to other antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic add, phenobarbitai, primidone) has no clinically significant effect on their steady-state plasma concentrations, except in some patients where the addition of topiramate to phenytoin may result in an increase of plasma concentrations of phenytoin.CNS Depressants: Topiramate should be used with caution if used in combination with alcohol and other CNS depressants.Oral Contraceptives: In an interaction study with a combined oral contraceptive, Topiramate increased plasma clearance of the oestrogenic component significantly. Consequently, and bearing in mind the potential risk of teratogenicity, patients should receive a preparation containing not less than 50 \u03bcg of oestrogen or use some alternative non-hormonal method of contraception. Patients taking oral contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns.Lithium: In patients with bipolar disorder, the pharmacokinetics of lithium were unaffected during treatment with Topiramate at doses of 200 mg/day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure (26% for AUC) following Topiramate doses of up to 600 mg/day. Lithium levels should be monitored when co-administered with Topiramate.Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ): The steady-state pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly influenced by the concomitant administration of Topiramate. Clinical laboratory results indicated decreases in serum potassium after Topiramate or HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ and Topiramate were administered in combination.Metformin: Topiramate did not affect metformin tmax. The clinical significance of the effect of topiramate on metformin pharmacokinetics is unclear. Oral plasma clearance of topiramate appears to be reduced when administered with metformin. The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on topiramate pharmacokinetics is unclear. When Topiramate is added or withdrawn in patients on metformin therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.Pioglitazone: When Topiramate is added to pioglitazone therapy or pioglitazone is added to Topiramate therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.Glibenclamide: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of Topiramate were unaffected by concomitant administration of glibenclamide. When Topiramate is added to glibenclamide therapy or glibenclamide is added to Topiramate therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.Others: Topiramate, when used concomitantly with other agents predisposing to nephrolithiasis, may increase the risk of nephrolithiasis. While using Topiramate, agents like these should be avoided since they may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of renal stone formation. The interaction with benzodiazepines has not been studied.\u00a0Valproic Acid: Concomitant administration of Topiramate and valproic acid has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. An association of hyperammonemia with Topiramate monotherapy or concomitant treatment with other anti epileptics has not been established.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan and is believed to exert its cytotoxic effects during the S-phase of DNA synthesis. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. This ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which leads to the induction of replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks, the formation of this ternary complex eventually leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death).Topotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (-1) and downstream (+1) base pairs. Intercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing religation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the enzyme\u2013substrate complex, Topotecan acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Torasemide inhibits the Na+/K+/2CI- carrier system (via interference of the chloride binding site) in the lumen of the thick ascending portion of the loop of Henle, resulting in a decrease in reabsorption of sodium and chloride. This results in an increase in the rate of delivery of tubular fluid and electrolytes to the distal sites of hydrogen and potassium ion secretion, while plasma volume contraction increases aldosterone production. The increased delivery and high aldosterone levels promote sodium reabsorption at the distal tubules, and By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, torasemide indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. Torasemide's effects in other segments of the nephron have not been demonstrated. Thus torasemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance. Torasemide's effects as a antihypertensive are due to its diuretic actions. By reducing extracellular and plasma fluid volume, blood pressure is reduced temporarily, and cardiac output also decreases.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Congestive heart failure: The usual initial oral dose is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily. If the diuretic response is inadequate, the dose should be titrated upward by approximately doubling until the desired diuretic response is obtained. Single doses higher than 200 mg have not been adequately studied.Chronic renal failure: The usual initial oral dose is 20 mg once daily. lf the diuretic response is inadequate, the dose should be titrated upward by approximately doubling until the desired diuretic response is obtained. Single doses higher than 200mg have not been adequately studied.Hepatic cirrhosis: The usual initial oral dose is 5 mg or 10 mg once daily, administered together with an aldosterone antagonist or a potassium sparing diuretic. If the diuretic response is inadequate, the dose should be titrated upward by approximately doubling until the desired diuretic response is obtained. Single doses higher than 40 mg have not been adequately studied. Chronic use of any diuretic in hepatic disease has not been studied in adequate and well-controlled trials.Hypertension: The usual initial oral dose is 2.5-5 mg once daily. If the 5 mg dose does not provide adequate reduction of blood pressure within 4 to 6 weeks, the dose may be increased to 10 mg once daily. If the response to 10 mg is insufficient, an additional antihypertensive should be added to the treatment regimen.",
    "Interaction": "Increased risk of severe hypokalaemia with amphotercin B, corticosteroids, carbenoxolone, hypokalaemia-causing medications. Increased risk of lithium toxicity. Increased potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity with nephrotoxic or ototoxic medications e.g. aminoglycosides. High dose salicylates may increase the risk of salicylate toxicity. Increased risk of toxicity with digoxin. Reduced diuretic effect with NSAIDs. Increased risk of hypotension with antihypertensives.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic compound. It inhibits the re uptake of neurotransmitters- serotonin and noradrenaline. Thus it modifies the transmission of pain impulses by activating both descending serotonergic pathways and noradrenergic pathways involved in analgesia. The analgesic effects of Tramadol are mediated via stimulation of mu-opioid receptors and indirect modulation of central monoaminergic inhibitory pathways.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Capsule or Tablet: Usual doses are 50 to 100 mg every four to six hours. For acute pain an initial dose of 100 mg is required. For chronic painful conditions an initial dose of 50 mg is recommended. Subsequent doses should be 50 to 100 mg administered 4-6 hourly. The dose level and frequency of dosing will depend on the severity of the pain.The total daily dosage by mouth should not exceed 400 mg.Sustained Release Capsule\u00a0or Tablet: One SR capsule\u00a0or tablet every 12 hours, for example first one in the morning and then at the same time in the evening. The number of capsules taken at a time will depend upon severity of pain, but it should not be taken more frequently than every 12 hours.The total daily dosage by mouth should not exceed 400 mg.Injection: A dose of 50-100 mg may be given every 4 to 6 hours by intramuscular or by intravenous infusion. For the treatment of postoperative pain,the initial dose is 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 10 to 20 minutes if necessary to a maximum of 250 mg in the first hour. Thereafter, doses are 50 to 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours up to a total daily dose of 600 mg.Suppository: Tramadol suppository should be administered rectally. For adults usual dose is 100 mg Tramadol Hydrochloride 6 hourly. In general, 400 mg Tramadol Hydrochloride (4 Tramadol suppository) per day sufficient. However, for the treatment of Cancer pain and severe pain after operations much higher daily doses can be used.",
    "Interaction": "In general, physician need not be concerned about drugs interacting with Tramadol. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors represent the only drug class not recommended for combination with Tramadol. Concomitant administration of carbamazepine with Tramadol causes a significant increase in Tramadol metabolism and it requires to increase the dose of Tramadol.",
    "Contraindications": "Tramadol is contraindicated in persons having hypersensitivity to this drug. It is also contraindicated in acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids or psychotropic drugs.",
    "Side Effects": "Commonly occurring side-effects are dizziness/vertigo, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, CNS stimulation, asthenia, sweating, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea. Less commonly occurring side-effects include malaise, allergic reaction, weight loss, vasodilatation, palpitations, abdominal pain, anorexia, flatulence, GI bleeding, hepatitis, stomatitis etc.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Safe use of Tramadol in pregnancy has not been established. Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the foetus. Tramadol Hydrochloride should not be administered during breast feeding as Tramadol and its metabolites have been detected in breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Respiratory depression: When large doses of tramadol are administered with anaesthetic with anaesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Therefore, tramadol should be administered cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression.Opioid dependence: Tramadol is not recommended for patients who are dependent on opioids.Concomitant CNS depressants: Tramadol should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administering to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics.Concomitant MAO inhibitors: Tramadol should be used with great caution in patients taking MAO inhibitors, since tramadol inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.Tramadol should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury and patients with acute abdominal conditions.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "This is a preparation of tranexamic acid (trans-4 aminomethyl-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid). Tranexamic acid is a substance endowed with a strong antifibrinolytic action and both in vivo and in vitro it has proved to be 10 times more active than conventional hemostatics, depending on the test. The antihemorrhagic action of tranexamic acid is essentially due to an inhibition of the plasminogen activation of both exogenous activators like streptokinase and endogenous ones like urokinase and the plasminogen tissue activator. This fact is particularly important for the clinical use of Tranexamic Acid, because it ensures an antihemorrhagic activity with an antifibrinolytic mechanism under a variety of conditions.The acute toxicity of Tranexamic Acid is extremely low and chronic toxicity almost non-existent. Tranexamic Acid is well absorbed by oral route and the effect is already seen 15-30 minutes after administration. It is excreted mainly by renal route but more slowly than conventional hemostatics. These features make the Tranexamic Acid effect more lasting than those conventional hemostatics. Considerably lower single doses of Tranexamic Acid can thus be administered at greater intervals without the drug plasma levels dropping to inefficient levels of antifibrinolytic activity between one dose and the other.Tranexamic Acid at therapeutic doses does not interfere with clotting processes and even a prolonged administration has not been seen to be accompanied by any tendency to thrombophilia.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults-\n\nThe usual dose: 500-1000 mg 3 times daily.\nFor prophylaxis: The mean recommended daily doses are 0.5-1 gm orally, 500 mg by the parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) route.\nFor therapy of hemorrhagic manifestations: the oral dose increases to 1-3 gm given in divided doses: in cases of particular seriousness and urgency, begin by injecting an ampoule (500 mg) slowly by intravenous route and administer the necessary subsequent oral doses.\n\r\nChildren-\n\nFor prophylaxis: For every kg of body weight from 5-10 mg are orally administered daily in divided doses.\nFor therapeutic purposes: The oral doses are doubled (from 10 to 20 mg/kg), while the intravenous and intramuscular treatment is begun with 10 mg/kg (=0.5 ml every 5 kg) by the slow intravenous route, continuing the oral administration up to the required dose. Where it is more convenient (e.g. in small babies) the ampoules, diluted in a little sweetened water, maybe orally administered instead of the Capsules.\n\r\nElderly patients: No reduction in dosage is necessary unless there is evidence of renal failure.",
    "Interaction": "Tranexamic Acid is a synthetic Amino Acid that is incompatible with solutions containing penicillins (eg: Benzyl penicillin). Thrombolytic drugs like Streptokinase & Urokinase antagonise the antifibrinolytic action of Tranexamic Acid. The potential for thrombus formation may be increased by concomitant administration of estrogen containing drugs, like oral contraceptives. Direct admixture of Tranexamic Acid with whole blood should be avoided during Transfusion.",
    "Contraindications": "Known individual hypersensitivity to the product. Thromboembolic disease, arterial and venous thrombosis, endocavitary hemorrhages, serious kidney failure.",
    "Side Effects": "Tranexamic Acid is generally well tolerated; there may be infrequent cases of sense of fatigue, conjunctival irritation, nasal blockage, itching, skin reddening, exanthems.\nAfter oral administration there may be sign of nausea, diarrhea, gastric pyrosis.\nThere are rare cases of postural hypotension.\nIn the case of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid, avoid or suspend treatment and start a suitable therapy.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Since the transplacental passage of the drug and its possible effects on the fetus are unknown, Tranexamic Acid should not be administered during known and presumed pregnancy. Tranexamic Acid passes into breast milk to a concentration of approximately one hundredth of the concentration in the maternal blood. An antifibrinolytic effect in the infant is unlikely.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Tranexamic Acid should be used in cases where there is hyperfibrinolysis. The prophylactic treatment must begin 24 hours before the operation and continue until 3-4 days after it.\nThe therapy of hemorrhages must be prolonged for at least 24 hours after manifestations have disappeared.\nIn hematuria, especially when this is not accompanied by any other hemorrhagic manifestations, reduce the doses to prevent formation of clots in the urinary tract.\nTranexamic Acid must not be used in serious renal insufficiency or anuric syndromes and must only be used with caution in less serious renal dysfunctions.\nThe administration of product requires particular care in cardiopathic and hepatopathic subjects.",

There is no information regarding the presence of Trastuzumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Cardiomyopathy: Trastuzumab can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death. Trastuzumab can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There is a 4-6 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving Trastuzumab as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving Trastuzumab. The highest absolute incidence occurs when Trastuzumab is administered with an anthracycline. Withhold Trastuzumab for \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. The safety of continuation or resumption of Trastuzumab in patients with Trastuzumab-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied.Cardiac Monitoring: Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended:\n\nBaseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of Trastuzumab\nLVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of Trastuzumab\nRepeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if Trastuzumab is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction.\nLVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of Trastuzumab as a component of adjuvant therapy.\n\nInfusion Reactions: Infusion reactions consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and chills, and on occasion included nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, rash, and asthenia. Serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction. Interrupt Trastuzumab infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions. There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with Trastuzumab after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of Trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated Trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Trastuzumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of Trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of Trastuzumab.Pulmonary Toxicity: Trastuzumab use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity.Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia: In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3-4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving Trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received Trastuzumab and those who did not.",

    "name": "Trastuzumab Emtansine",
    "generic_id": "1427",
    "Indications": "Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC): Trastuzumab Emtansine, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received prior treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Trastuzumab Emtansine is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate which contains the humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, trastuzumab, covalently linked to the microtubule inhibitory drug DM1 (a maytansine derivative) via the stable thioether linker MCC (4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate). Emtansine refers to the MCC-DM1 complex. An average of 3.5 DM1 molecules are conjugated to each molecule of trastuzumab.Conjugation of DM1 to trastuzumab confers selectivity of the cytotoxic agent for HER2-overexpressing tumor cells, thereby increasing intracellular delivery of DM1 directly to malignant cells. Upon binding to HER2, trastuzumab emtansine undergoes receptor-mediated internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation, resulting in release of DM1-containing cytotoxic catabolites (primarily lysine-MCC-DM1).Trastuzumab Emtansine has the mechanisms of action of both trastuzumab and DM1.Trastuzumab emtansine, like trastuzumab, binds to domain IV of the HER2 extracellular domain (ECD), as well as to Fc\u03b3 receptors and complement C1q. In addition, Trastuzumab Emtansine, like trastuzumab, inhibits shedding of the HER2 ECD, inhibits signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, and mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in human breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2.DM1, the cytotoxic drug component of Trastuzumab Emtansine, binds to tubulin. By inhibiting tubulin polymerization, both DM1 and Trastuzumab Emtansine cause cells to arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death. Results from in vitro cytotoxicity assays show that DM1 is 20\u2013200 times more potent than taxanes and vinca alkaloids.The MCC linker is designed to limit systemic release and increase targeted delivery of DM1, as demonstrated by detection of very low levels of free DM1 in plasma.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended Doses And Schedules: The recommended dose of Trastuzumab Emtansine is 3.6 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\u00a0Do not administer Trastuzumab Emtansine at doses greater than 3.6 mg/kg.\u00a0Do not substitute Trastuzumab Emtansine for or with trastuzumab. Closely monitor the infusion site for possible subcutaneous infiltration during drug administrationFirst Infusion: Administer infusion over 90 minutes. Patients should be observed during the infusion and for at least 90 minutes following the initial dose for fever, chills, or other infusionrelated reactions\u00a0Subsequent Infusions: Administer over 30 minutes if prior infusions were well tolerated. Patients should be observed during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes after infusion.",
    "Interaction": "No formal drug-drug interaction studies with trastuzumab emtansine in humans have been conducted. In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes suggest that DM1, a component of trastuzumab emtansine, is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A5. DM1 does not induce or inhibit P450-mediated metabolism in vitro. Caution should be taken when trastuzumab emtansine is co-administered with potent CYP3A inhibitors.",

No reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have been conducted with trastuzumab emtansine. Trastuzumab, a component of trastuzumab emtansine, can cause fetal harm or death when administered to a pregnant woman. In the postmarketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, have been reported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. Animal studies of maytansine, a closely related chemical entity of the same maytansinoid class as DM1, suggest that DM1, the microtubule inhibiting cytotoxic drug component of trastuzumab emtansine, is expected to be teratogenic and potentially embryotoxic.Administration of trastuzumab emtansine to pregnant women is not recommended. Women who become pregnant must contact their doctor and should be advised of the possibility of harm to the fetus. If a pregnant woman is treated with trastuzumab emtansine, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is recommended.Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether trastuzumab emtansine is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Kadcyla, women should discontinue nursing prior to initiating treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. Women may begin nursing 7 months after concluding treatment.",

If after initiation of treatment of Tretinoin the presence of the t(15;17) translocation is not confirmed by cytogenetics and/or by polymerase chain reaction studies and the patient has not responded to Tretinoin, alternative therapy appropriate for acute myelogenous leukemia should be considered. Tretinoin is for the induction of remission only. Optimal consolidation or maintenance regimens have not been determined. All patients should, therefore, receive a standard consolidation and/or maintenance chemotherapy regimen for APL after induction therapy with Tretinoin, unless otherwise contraindicated.",
    "Interaction": "As Tretinoin is metabolized by the hepatic P450 system, there is a potential for alteration of pharmacokinetics parameters in patients administered concomitant medications that are also inducers or inhibitors of this system. Medications that generally induce hepatic P450 enzymes include rifampicin, glucocorticoids, phenobarbital and pentobarbital. Medications that generally inhibit hepatic P450 enzymes include ketoconazole, cimetidine, erythromycin, verapamil, diltiazem and cyclosporine. To date there are no data to suggest that co-use with these medications increases or decreases either efficacy or toxicity of Tretinoin.",
    "Contraindications": "Tretinoin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Tretinoin, any of its components, or other retinoids. Tretinoin should not be given to patients who are sensitive to parabens, which are used as preservatives in the gelatin capsule.",
    "Side Effects": "Virtually all patients experience some drug-related toxicity, especially headache, fever, weakness, and fatigue. These adverse effects are seldom permanent or irreversible nor do they usually require interruption of therapy. Some of the adverse events are common in patients with APL, including hemorrhage, infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia, septicemia, and cerebral hemorrhage. The following describes the adverse events, regardless of drug relationship, that were observed in patients treated with Tretinoin.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. Tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys, and may be expected to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin causes fetal resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses in all animals studied. Although experience with humans administered Tretinoin is extremely limited, increased spontaneous abortions and major human fetal abnormalities related to the use of other retinoids have been documented in humans.Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Tretinoin in nursing infants, mothers should discontinue nursing prior to taking this drug.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Tretinoin has potentially significant toxic side effects in APL patients. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of respiratory compromise and/or leukocytosis. Supportive care appropriate for APL patients, eg, prophylaxis for bleeding, prompt therapy for infection, should be maintained during therapy with Tretinoin.There is a risk of thrombosis (both venous and arterial) which may involve any organ system, during the first month of treatment. Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating patients with the combination of Tretinoin and anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid or aprotinin.The ability to drive or operate machinery might be impaired in patients treated with Tretinoin, particularly if they are experiencing dizziness or severe headache. Microdosed progesterone preparations (\"minipill\") may be an inadequate method of contraception during treatment with Tretinoin.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Like other topical corticosteroids, triamcinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Press a small dab (about 1/4 inch) to the lesion until a thin film develops. A larger quantity may be required for coverage of some lesions. For optimal results use only enough to coat the lesion with a thin film. Do not rub in. Attempting to spread this preparation may result in a granular, gritty sensation and cause it to crumble. After application, however, a smooth, slippery film develops. The preparation should be applied at bedtime to permit steroid contact with the lesion throughout the night. Depending on the severity of symptoms, it may be necessary to apply the preparation two or three times a day, preferably after meals. If significant repair or regeneration has not occurred in seven days, further investigation is advisable.",
    "Interaction": "Not available",
    "Contraindications": "Triamcinolone acetonide dental paste is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation; it is also contraindicated in the presence of fungal, viral, or bacterial infections of the mouth or throat.",
    "Side Effects": "The following local adverse reactions may occur with corticosteroid-containing dental pastes: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, blistering or peeling not present prior to therapy, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the oral mucosa, secondary infection, and atrophy of the oral mucosa.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. Triamcinolone acetonide has been shown to induce teratogenic effects in several species. It is not known whether oral application of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Caution should be exercised when corticosteroid- containing dental pastes are prescribed for a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Triamcinolone acetonide dental paste may cause local adverse reactions. If irritation develops, triamcinolone acetonide dental paste should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact sensitization with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.If concomitant mucosal infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of triamcinolone acetonide dental paste should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. If significant regeneration or repair of oral tissues has not occurred in seven days, additional investigation into the etiology of the oral lesion is advised.Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and other adverse effects known to occur with parenterally-administered steroid preparations; therefore, it may be advisable to periodically evaluate patients on prolonged therapy with corticosteroid-containing dental pastes for evidence of HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug or to reduce the frequency of application. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of therapy.",

Dermatologic diseases: Bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, exfoliative erythroderma, mycosis fungoides, pemphigus, severe erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).Endocrine disorders: Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocortisone or cortisone is the drug of choice; synthetic analogs may be used in conjunction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy, mineralocorticoid supplementation is of particular importance), congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercalcemia associated with cancer, nonsuppurative thyroiditis.Gastrointestinal diseases: To tide the patient over a critical period of the disease in regional enteritis and ulcerative colitis.Hematologic disorders: Acquired (autoimmune) hemolytic anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, pure red cell aplasia, selected cases of secondary thrombocytopenia.Neoplastic diseases: For the palliative management of leukemias and lymphomas.Nervous system: Acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis; cerebral edema associated with primary or metastatic brain tumor or craniotomy.Ophthalmic diseases: Sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis, uveitis, and ocular inflammatory conditions unresponsive to topical corticosteroids.Renal diseases: To induce diuresis or remission of proteinuria in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or that due to lupus erythematosus.Respiratory diseases: Berylliosis, fulminating or disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy, idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias, symptomatic sarcoidosis.Miscellaneous: Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement, tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy.Intra-articular: The intra-articular or soft tissue administration of Triamcinolone injection is indicated as adjunctive therapy for short-term administration (to tide the patient over an acute episode or exacerbation) in acute gouty arthritis, acute and subacute bursitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, epicondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, synovitis or osteoarthritis.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Triamcinolone Acetonide occurs as a white to cream-colored, crystalline powder having not more than a slight odor and is practically insoluble in water and very soluble in alcohol. It is a synthetic glucocorticoid corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory action. This formulation is suitable for intramuscular and intra-articular use only.Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (e.g. hydrocortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Synthetic analogs such as triamcinolone are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Triamcinolone injection has an extended duration of effect which may be sustained over a period of several weeks. Studies indicate that following a single intramuscular dose of 60 mg to 100 mg of Triamcinolone Acetonide, adrenal suppression occurs within 24 to 48 hours and then gradually returns to normal, usually in 30 to 40 days. This finding correlates closely with the extended duration of therapeutic action achieved with the drug.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "General\n\nDosage: The initial dose of Triamcinolone injection may vary from 2.5 mg to 100 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified. Dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient.\nAdministration: Strict aseptic technique is mandatory. The vial should be shaken before use to ensure a uniform suspension. Prior to withdrawal, the suspension should be inspected for clumping or granular appearance (agglomeration).\n\r\nSystemic\n\nDosage: The suggested initial dose is 60 mg, injected deeply into the gluteal muscle. Atrophy of subcutaneous fat may occur if the injection is not properly given. Dosage is usually adjusted within the range of 40 mg to 80 mg, depending upon patient response and duration of relief. However, some patients may be well controlled on doses as low as 20 mg or less. Pediatric patients: The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 divided doses.\nAdministration: For systemic therapy, injection should be made deeply into the gluteal muscle. For adults, a minimum needle length of 11/2 inches is recommended. In obese patients, a longer needle may be required. Use alternative sites for subsequent injections.\n\r\nLocal\n\nDosage: Intra-articular administration: A single local injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide is frequently sufficient, but several injections may be needed for adequate relief of symptoms. Initial dose: 2.5 mg to 5 mg for smaller joints and from 5 mg to 15 mg for larger joints, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. For adults, doses up to 10 mg for smaller areas and up to 40 mg for larger areas have usually been sufficient. Single injections into several joints, up to a total of 80 mg, have been given.\nAdministration: For treatment of joints, the usual intra-articular injection technique should be followed. If an excessive amount of synovial fluid is present in the joint, some, but not all, should be aspirated to aid in the relief of pain and to prevent undue dilution of the steroid.",
    "Interaction": "Aminoglutethimide: Aminoglutethimide may lead to a loss of corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression.\u00a0Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents: When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (ie, amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.\u00a0Antibiotics: Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance.\u00a0Anticholinesterases: Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.\u00a0Anticoagulants, oral: Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.\u00a0Antidiabetics: Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.\u00a0Antitubercular drugs: Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased.\u00a0Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids.\u00a0Cyclosporine: Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use.\u00a0Digitalis glycosides: Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.\u00a0Estrogens, including oral contraceptives: Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.\u00a0Hepatic enzyme inducers (eg, barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin): Drugs which induce hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.\u00a0Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.\u00a0Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.\u00a0Skin tests: Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests.\u00a0Vaccines: Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible.",

Arachnoiditis, meningitis, paraparesis/paraplegia and sensory disturbances have occurred after intrathecal administration.Ophthalmic: Exophthalmos, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts, rare instances of blindness associated with periocular injections.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential Ask to the fetus. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "General: This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive to heat. Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision most be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Cardio-Renal As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension or renal insufficiency.Endocrine: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.Gastrointestinal: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Intra-articular Administration: Intra-articularly injected corticosteroids may be systemically absorbed. Appropriate examination of any joint fluid present is necessary to exclude a septic process.Musculoskeletal: Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (ie, decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function.Neuro-Psychiatric: Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.Ophthalmic: Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored.",

    "Pharmacology": "The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Firstly, however, these glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptors which translocate into the nucleus and bind DNA (GRE) and change genetic expression both positively and negatively. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.Triamcinolone Acetonide is a more potent derivative of Triamcinolone and is approximately 8 times more potent than prednisone. Corticosteroids are very effective in the treatment of allergic diseases in man.

    "Indications": "Triamcinolone Acetonide topical preparation is indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczematous dermatitis, neurodermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, insect bites, lichen simplex chronicus, exfoliative dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, nummular eczema, psoriasis and pruritus ani and vulvae.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Triamcinolone Acetonide (a derivative of Triamcinolone) in a compatible base. Topical steroids are primarily effective because of their anti-inflammatory, antipruritic & vasoconstrictive actions.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "A small amount of Triamcinolone is gently rub to the affected area 1-2 times daily. Some cases of eczematised psoriasis may be treated more effectively by the application of Triamcinolone under an occlusive dressing.Occlusive dressing technique: Gently rub a small amount of Triamcinolone on the lesion until it disappears. Then reapply, leaving a thin coating and cover with a pliable non porous film. For convenience apply Triamcinolone intermittently (12 hour occlusion during the night) followed by reapplication without occlusion, during the day.Pediatric use: Triamcinolone\u00a0should not be used in children under 8 years. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children. As children are more likely to get side effects, they should not normally be treated for longer than 5 days.",
    "Interaction": "Not available",
    "Contraindications": "Triamcinolone Acetonide is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation. It is also contraindicated in tuberculosis of the skin, fungus infections and viral diseases of the skin (Herpes simplex, chickenpox and vaccinia), perioral dermatitis, rosacea and ulcerative conditions.",
    "Side Effects": "The following local side effects have been reported with topical corticosteroids, either with or without occlusive dressings: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae and miliaria.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroid should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroid could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "If reactions or idiosyncrasies are encountered, Triamcinolone Acetonide should be discontinued. The use of topical steroids on infected areas should be attended with caution and careful observation, bearing in mind the potential spreading of infections by anti-inflammatory steroids and the possible advisability of discontinuing steroid therapy and/or initiating antibacterial measures.Triamcinolone Acetonide should not be used on healthy skin or over large areas of skin and not to be used in the eye as there is potential risk of glaucoma and cataract. When steroids are applied for long periods of time (more than 4 weeks) the occurrence of atrophic striae is likely. Prolonged use on flexures and intertriginous areas is undesirable. Children may absorb proportionately larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. In infants, long term continuous topical steroid therapy should be avoided. Adrenal suppression can occur even without occlusion.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Triamterene directly inhibits the exchange of Na for K and hydrogen in the distal renal tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of Na and Cl ions, and consequently of water, by reducing electrolyte reabsorption from the renal tubules.Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "May reduce the renal clearance of lithium. May antagonise diuretic effect with NSAIDs, corticosteroids, oestrogens, combined OCs. Enhanced effect with other hypotensive agents, baclofen, tizanidine. May decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. Increases responsiveness to tubocurarine. Risk of acute renal failure with indometacin. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia with reboxetine, tacrolimus. Increased risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity with platinum compounds (e.g. cisplatin).",
    "Contraindications": "Antikaliuretic Therapy and Potassium Supplementation: Dyazide should not be given to patients receiving other potassium-sparing agents such as spironolactone, amiloride, or other formulations containing triamterene. Concomitant potassium-containing salt substitutes should also not be used. Potassium supplementation should not be used with Dyazide except in severe cases of hypokalemia. Such concomitant therapy can be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels. If potassium supplementation is used, careful monitoring of the serum potassium level is necessary.Impaired Renal Function: Dyazide is contraindicated in patients with anuria, acute and chronic renal insufficiency or significant renal impairment.Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity to either drug in the preparation or to other sulfonamidederived drugs is a contraindication.Hyperkalemia: Dyazide should not be used in patients with preexisting elevated serum potassium.",
    "Side Effects": "Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus-like reactions, photosensitivity.Cardiovascular: Arrhythmia, postural hypotension.Metabolic: Diabetes mellitus, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, acidosis, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia, hypochloremia.Gastrointestinal: Jaundice and/or liver enzyme abnormalities, pancreatitis, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.Renal: Acute renal failure (one case of irreversible renal failure has been reported), interstitial nephritis, renal stones composed primarily of triamterene, elevated BUN, and serum creatinine, abnormal urinary sediment.Hematologic: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and purpura, megaloblastic anemia.Musculoskeletal: Muscle cramps.Central Nervous System: Weakness, fatigue, dizziness, headache, dry mouth.Miscellaneous: Impotence, sialadenitis.Central Nervous System: Paresthesias, vertigo.Ophthalmic: Xanthopsia, transient blurred vision.Respiratory: Allergic pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, respiratory distress.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy woman is inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard. Diuretics do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy, and there is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in the treatment of developed toxemia. Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathological causes or from the physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Diuretics are indicated in pregnancy when edema is due to pathologic causes, just as they are in the absence of pregnancy.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Diabetes: Caution should be exercised when administering Dyazide to patients with diabetes, since thiazides may cause hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and alter insulin requirements in diabetes. Also, diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide administration. Impaired Hepatic Function: Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. They can precipitate hepatic coma in patients with severe liver disease. Potassium depletion induced by the thiazide may be important in this connection. Administer Dyazide cautiously and be alert for such early signs of impending coma as confusion, drowsiness, and tremor; if mental confusion increases discontinue Dyazide for a few days. Attention must be given to other factors that may precipitate hepatic coma, such as blood in the gastrointestinal tract or preexisting potassium depletion.Hypokalemia: Hypokalemia is uncommon with Dyazide; but, should it develop, corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased intake of potassium-rich foods. Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels, especially in patients receiving digitalis or with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. If serious hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.0 mEq/L) is demonstrated by repeat serum potassium determinations, Dyazide should be discontinued and potassium chloride supplementation initiated. Less serious hypokalemia should be evaluated with regard to other coexisting conditions and treated accordingly.Electrolyte Imbalance: Electrolyte imbalance, often encountered in such conditions as heart failure, renal disease or cirrhosis of the liver, may also be aggravated by diuretics and should be considered during therapy with Dyazide when using high doses for prolonged periods or in patients on a salt-restricted diet. Serum determinations of electrolytes should be performed, and are particularly important if the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving fluids parenterally. Possible fluid and electrolyte imbalance may be indicated by such warning signs as: dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/1106/trihexyphenidyl-hydrochloride": {
    "name": "Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride",
    "generic_id": "1106",
    "Indications": "Trihexyphenidyl tablet is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic). It is often useful as adjuvant therapy when treating these forms of Parkinsonism with levodopa. Additionally, it is indicated for the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs such as the dibenzoxazepines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Trihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype. In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally. Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Dosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether Trihexyphenidyl may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If Trihexyphenidyl tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment for Parkinsonism may result in acute exacerbation of Parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).Idiopathic Parkinsonism: As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of Trihexyphenidyl form may be administered the first day. The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose will depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: The size and frequency of the Trihexyphenidyl dose needed to control extrapyramidal reactions to commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as little as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled in a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased until satisfactory control is achieved. Satisfactory control may sometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the dosage of the tranquilizer when instituting Trihexyphenidyl therapy and then adjusting the dosage of both drugs until the desired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal reactions. It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced Trihexyphenidyl dosage after the reactions have remained under control for several days. Instances have been reported in which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods after Trihexyphenidyl therapy was discontinued.Concomitant use with Levodopa: When Trihexyphenidyl is used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need to be reduced. Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side effects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl dosage of 3 to 6mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate. Concomitant use with other Parasympathetic Inhibitors: Trihexyphenidyl may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution initially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose of Trihexyphenidyl is increased.The total daily intake of Trihexyphenidyl tablet is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes. High doses (>10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the fourth at bedtime.Use in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "Cannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with, and thus, an abuse potential exists. Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as , as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics. The usual dose of either or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements.",
    "Contraindications": "Trihexyphenidyl is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Trihexyphenidyl. Trihexyphenidyl is also contraindicated in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Blindness after long-term use due to narrow angle glaucoma has been reported.",
    "Side Effects": "Minor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Trihexyphenidyl than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with Trihexyphenidyl. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including Trihexyphenidyl, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion and memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular pressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. Exacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma in patients receiving Trihexyphenidyl has been reported (blindness has been reported in some cases). Paradoxical sinus bradycardia, dry skin, and cycloplegia have been reported. In addition to adverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been reported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, forgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no controlled data in animal or human pregnancy. Trihexyphenidyl HCI is only recommended for use during pregnancy when need has been clearly established and benefit outweighs risk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Trihexyphenidyl HCI is administered to a nursing woman. As with other anticholinergics, Trihexyphenidyl HCI may cause suppression of lactation. Therefore, Trihexyphenidyl HCI should only be used if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the infant.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Patients to be treated with Trihexyphenidyl should have a gonioscope evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and close monitoring of intraocular pressures. The use of anticholinergic drugs may precipitate angle closure with an increase in intraocular pressure. If blurring of vision occurs during therapy, the possibility of narrow angle glaucoma should be considered. Blindness has been reported due to aggravation of narrow angle glaucoma. Trihexyphenidyl should be administered with caution in hot weather, especially when given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, alcoholics, those who have central nervous system disease, or those who do manual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some disturbance of sweating already exists. If there isevidence of anhidrosis, the possibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium via perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have occurred with the use of anticholinergics under the conditions described above. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with dose reduction or discontinuation of Trihexyphenidyl. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).",

    "Indications": "Trilaciclib is indicated to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecancontaining regimen for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Trilaciclib is a transient inhibitor of CDK 4 and 6. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow give rise to circulating neutrophils, RBCs, and platelets. HSPC proliferation is dependent on CDK4/6 activity.Bone Marrow: Trilaciclib exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of CD45+/CD3+ lymphocyte proliferation following administration of single-dose Trilaciclib 96 or 192 mg/m 2 (0.4 or 0.8 times the approved recommended dose) in healthy subjects. Trilaciclib increased the percentage of cells arrested in G1 up to 32 hours post-infusion for all bone marrow progenitor subsets evaluated (hematopoietic stem cell/multipotent progenitor, oligopotent progenitor, monocyte lineage, granulocyte lineage, erythroid lineage, and megakaryocyte lineage) following a single dose of Trilaciclib 192 mg/m2 (0.8 times the approved recommended dose) in healthy subjects. Partial recovery of the total bone marrow with resumption of proliferation of the bone marrow progenitor subsets was observed by 32 hours post-dose. This transient G1 arrest of hematopoietic stem cells contributed to the myeloprotective effect of Trilaciclib.Cardiac Electrophysiology: Trilaciclib is associated with dose-dependent and delayed increase in the QTc interval. The underlying mechanism of the delayed QT effect is unknown. At the clinical dose of 240 mg/m 2, Trilaciclib did not have a clinically relevant effect on QTc (i.e., >10 msec). QTc prolongation was observed at higher doses.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "Trilaciclib is an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K. Co-administration of Trilaciclib may increase the concentration or net accumulation of OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K substrates in the kidney (e.g., Dofetilide, Dalfampridine, and Cisplatin).",
    "Contraindications": "Trilaciclib is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to Trilaciclib. Reactions have included anaphylaxis.",

    "Indications": "Tropicamide sterile eye drops is used to dilate (enlarge) the pupil so that the doctor can see into the back of the eye. It is used before eye examinations, such as cycloplegic refraction and examination of the fundus of the eye. Tropicamide eye drops may also be used before and after eye surgery.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tropicamide, which is to some extent structurally related to atropine, induces mydriasis and cycloplegia through paralysis of the parasympathetic system. Tropicamide is a parasympatholytic agent, which acts by blocking the action of the parasympathetic nervous system. As acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter at the receptor site of the parasympathetic nervous system, tropicamide competes with acetylcholine for uptake at the receptor sites, thereby blocking its action. The results are mydriasis, due to unopposed action of the dilator pupillae, and cycloplegia.Tropicamide visibly dilates the pupil after 5 minutes. It reaches its maximum diameter after 20-25 minutes and returns to its normal size within approx. 6 hours. The onset of the effect is rapid, but it disappears 45-60 minutes after the last instillation. The best time for retinoscopy is therefore approximately 20 minutes after the instillation of the last drop.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "For refraction: instill 1 or 2 drops in the eye(s), repeated in 5 minutes. If patient is not seen within 20 to 30 minutes, an additional drop may be instilled to prolong mydriatic effect. For examination of the fundus: instill 1 drop 15 to 20 minutes prior to examination.",
    "Interaction": "Atropine like substances, tricyclic antidepressants, numerous H1 antihistaminic substances, anti-cholinergic agents, anti-Parkinson drugs, phenothiazines and neuroleptic drugs are capable of reinforcing the effect of tropicamide when taken or used.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in narrow angle glaucoma, hypersensitivity to any component of the product.",
    "Side Effects": "A slight burning sensation may occur for a short time after instillation into the eye. In children, psychotic episodes, behavioral changes and cardio-respiratory collapse may occur. This medicament impairs the performance and responsiveness while driving or operating machinery. It can also lead to an increase in intraocular pressure, allergic reaction, dryness of the mouth, tachycardia and headache.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. Tropicamide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tropicamide is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Where appropriate, the administration of an antidote (miotic) after the examination should be considered. To reduce excessive systemic absorption, the patient should compress the tear duct of the treated eye with the finger for 2-3 minutes immediately after the instillation of the eye drops. In older patients, mydriatic and cycloplegic drugs should generally be used with care.",

    "name": "Trypan Blue",
    "generic_id": "1110",
    "Indications": "Trypan Blue is indicated for use as an aid in ophthalmic surgery by staining the anterior capsule of the lens.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Trypan Blue is a selective tissue staining agent (dye) which stains anterior lens capsule of the human crystalline lens. The dye does not penetrate the capsule, permitting visualization of the anterior capsule in contrast to the non-stained lens cortex and inner lens material.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The first step to administer Trypan Blue is to inject an air bubble into the anterior chamber using a 26 gauge needle. It prevents dilution of dye by the aqueous humor. Then Trypan Blue is injected into the anterior lens capsule using a tuberculin syringe. Sufficient staining is achieved as soon as the dye has contracted the capsule. If some area is left unstained, inject one more drop till it gets stained.",
    "Interaction": "Not available",
    "Contraindications": "Trypan Blue is contraindicated when a non-hydrated (dry state), hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) is planned to be inserted into the eye because the dye may be absorbed by the IOL and stain the IOL.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Tucatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2. In vitro, tucatinib inhibits phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3, resulting in inhibition of downstream MAPK and AKT signaling and cell proliferation, and showed anti-tumor activity in HER2 expressing tumor cells. In vivo, tucatinib inhibited the growth of HER2 expressing tumors. The combination of tucatinib and trastuzumab showed increased anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo compared to either drug alone.Exposure Response Relationship: Tucatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response have not been fully characterized.Cardiac Electrophysiology: No large mean increase in QTc (i.e., > 20 ms) was detected following treatment with Tucatinib at the recommended dose of 300 mg taken orally twice daily.Pharmacokinetics: Tucatinib AUC0-INF and Cmax increases proportionally over a dosage range from 50 mg to 300 mg (0.17 to 1 times the approved recommended dosage). Tucatinib exhibited 1.7-fold accumulation for AUC and 1.5-fold accumulation for Cmax following administration of Tucatinib 300 mg twice daily for 14 days. Time to steady state was approximately 4 days.Absorption: The median time to peak plasma concentration of Tucatinib was approximately 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours).Distribution: The geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution of tucatinib was approximately 1670 L (66%). The plasma protein binding was 97.1% at clinically relevant concentrations.Elimination: The geometric mean (CV%) half-life of tucatinib was approximately 8.5 (21%) hours and apparent clearance was 148 L/h (55%).Metabolism: Tucatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent via CYP3A.Excretion: Following a single oral dose of 300 mg radiolabeled Tucatinib, approximately 86% of the total radiolabeled dose was recovered in feces (16% of the administered dose as unchanged tucatinib) and 4.1% in urine with an overall total recovery of 90% within 13 days post-dose. In plasma, approximately 76% of the plasma radioactivity was unchanged, 19% was attributed to identified metabolites, and approximately 5% was unassigned.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended Dosage: The recommended dosage of Tucatinib is 300 mg taken orally twice daily in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are advised to swallow Tucatinib tablets whole and not to chew, crush, or split prior to swallowing. Patients are advised not to ingest tablet if it is broken, cracked, or not otherwise intact. Patients are advised to take Tucatinib approximately 12 hours apart and at the same time each day with or without a meal. If the patient vomits or misses a dose of Tucatinib, Patients are advised to take the next dose at its usual scheduled time. When given in combination with Tucatinib, the recommended dosage of capecitabine is 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily taken within 30 minutes after a meal . Tucatinib and capecitabine can be taken at the same time.Dosage Modifications for Severe Hepatic Impairment: For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), reduce the recommended dosage to 200 mg orally twice daily. Dosage Modifications for Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors with Tucatinib. If concomitant use with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the recommended dosage to 100 mg orally twice daily. After discontinuation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor for 3 elimination half-lives, resume the Tucatinib dose that was taken prior to initiating the inhibitor.",

    "Side Effects": "The following clinically significant side effects are observed: DiarrheA, Hepatotoxicity. The most common side effects in patients who received Tucatinib (>20%) were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia, and rash.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Tucatinib is used in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, Tucatinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .There are no available human data on Tucatinib use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Lactation: Tucatinib is used in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. There are no data on the presence of Tucatinib or its metabolites in human or animal milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Tucatinib and for at least 1 week after the last dose.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Diarrhea: Tucatinib can cause severe diarrhea including dehydration, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and death. In HER2CLIMB, 81% of patients who received Tucatinib experienced diarrhea, including 12% with Grade 3 diarrhea and 0.5% with Grade 4 diarrhea. Both patients who developed Grade 4 diarrhea subsequently died, with diarrhea as a contributor to death. The median time to onset of the first episode of diarrhea was 12 days and the median time to resolution was 8 days. Diarrhea led to dose reductions of Tucatinib in 6% of patients and discontinuation of Tucatinib in 1% of patients. Prophylactic use of antidiarrheal treatment was not required on HER2CLIMB. If diarrhea occurs, administer antidiarrheal treatment as clinically indicated. Perform diagnostic tests as clinically indicated to exclude other causes of diarrhea. Based on the severity of the diarrhea, interrupt dose, then reduce dose or permanently discontinue Tucatinib.Hepatotoxicity: Tucatinib can cause severe hepatotoxicity. In HER2CLIMB, 8% of patients who received Tucatinib had an ALT increase >5 x ULN, 6% had an AST increase >5 x ULN, and 1.5% had a bilirubin increase >3 x ULN (Grade >3). Hepatotoxicity led to dose reduction of Tucatinib in 8% of patients and discontinuation of Tucatinib in 1.5% of patients. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to starting Tucatinib, every 3 weeks during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of hepatotoxicity, interrupt dose, then reduce dose or permanently discontinue Tucatinib.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Tucatinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of Tucatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal mortality, reduced fetal weight and fetal abnormalities at maternal exposures >1.3 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Tucatinib and for at least 1 week after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Tucatinib and for at least 1 week after the last dose. Tucatinib is used in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine.",

Read moreTulobuterol Hydrochloride is indicated for prophylaxis and control of bronchospasm in bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, asthmatic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, bronchiectasis, tracheobronchitis with emphysema and other bronchospastic disorders and conditions characterized by bronchoconstriction. Because oral tulobuterol is long acting, it is ideally suited for routine maintenance therapy in chronic asthma and chronic bronchitis. Tulobuterol has been shown in controlled single and multiple-dose studies to be more effective than terbutaline and fenoterol and at least as effective as salbutamol (albuterol) in relieving bronchospasm associated with reversible obstructive airways disease such as asthma, and also chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Clinically significant improvement in pulmonary function, as demonstrated by an increase in FEV of 15% or more, occurred within 30 minutes after oral dosing with peak improvement occurring within two to three hours. In some patients, a therapeutic response was still apparent at 12 hours. Continued effectiveness was demonstrated over a one-year period.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The primary pharmacological action of beta-adrenergic drugs is to stimulate adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the formation of cyclic-3',5' adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cyclic AMP thus formed mediates the cellular response that results in bronchodilation. Tulobuterol, due to its highly selective action on beta-2 adrenoceptors, relaxes the bronchial smooth muscle and has been shown to be clinically successful in the symptomatic treatment of reversible obstructive airways disease (ROAD) such as bronchial asthma, and also in bronchitis and emphysema.Some bronchodilators stimulate beta-1 (cardiac) receptors in addition to beta-2 receptors and may cause tachycardia, angina, and possibly arrhythmias in susceptible patients. Animal studies and in vitro experiments indicate that tulobuterol is more selective in its beta-2 agonist activity than other agents in this class and, therefore, should produce fewer cardiac side effects.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "As long-term clinical studies have demonstrated, tulobuterol continues to be efficacious and does not result in cumulative or toxic side effects. Due to the variability of the disease and the need for individualized dosage requirements, flexibility in dosing is indispensable.The use of Long-Acting Beta Agonists is contraindicated without the use of an asthma controller medication such as inhaled corticosteroid.Long-Acting Beta Agonists should be used for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved. Patient should then be maintained on a long-term asthma controller medication (e.g. Corticosteroids).Tablets: The usual oral adult dose of tulobuterol is one 2 mg tablet twice a day. A convenient starting dose for children 12 years and over and adults is 1 mg twice a day, particularly for elderly patients and those with a history of sensitivity to beta-adrenergic agents. Unless precluded by drug-related side effects, the patient may have the dose increased after seven to ten days to 2 mg twice a day, if necessary, to achieve a greater therapeutic response.Although most patients can be maintained on a dose of 1 to 2 mg twice daily, the variability of patient response and severity of symptoms may require further adjustment of the dose, as with any bronchodilator treatment. Therefore, if necessary, the adult dose of tulobuterol may be increased to 6 mg a day in divided doses according to clinical response.Syrup: Based on dose-ranging studies in children, the usual dose of tulobuterol syrup (1 mg/5 mL) for children is 40 to 80 mcg/kg/day in two divided doses.In clinical studies in children, the effective dose has ranged from 20 to 100 mcg/kg/day.This leads to the following recommendations on the basis of age:\n\nFor children aged one to six years, 0.25 tsp. (1.25 mL) to 0.5 tsp. (2.5 mL) BID\nFor children aged six to twelve years, 0.5 tsp. (2.5 mL) to 1 tsp. (5 mL) BID\nFor children aged over twelve years, 1 tsp. (5 mL) to 2 tsp. (10 mL) BID\nThe above age recommended doses may have to be modified according to patient response.",
    "Interaction": "Increased risk of arrhythmia with digoxin. Hypokalaemia with concomitant admin of xanthines, corticosteroids and diuretics.",
    "Contraindications": "Administration of tulobuterol is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines or any of the formulation components.",
    "Side Effects": "The adverse reactions of tulobuterol are similar in nature to those of other sympathomimetic agents, however the incidence of certain cardiovascular effects is less with tulobuterol. Dose-related finger tremor is common with these agents, but the effects tend to lessen with continued administration of the drug. Oral formulations of tulobuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can also cause less frequent adverse reactions such as hypertension, palpitations, angina, tachycardia, vomiting, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, insomnia and headache.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Safety of this product for use during pregnancy has not been established. It is not known whether tulobuterol is excreted in human breast milk nor whether it has a harmful effect on the newborn. Therefore, as with any medication, the use of the drug in pregnancy, lactation, or women of childbearing potential requires that the expected therapeutic benefit of the drug be weighed against its possible hazards to the mother and child.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Long-Acting Beta Agonists should only be used long-term in patients whose asthma cannot be adequately controlled on asthma controller medications alone.Tulobuterol should be used with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and seizure disorders.Caution should be observed in patients with renal failure in view of the kidney being the principle route of elimination of the drug. Dosage may also require individualization in patients with impaired liver function as normally tulobuterol is extensively metabolized by the liver.As with other sympathomimetic bronchodilator agents, tulobuterol should be administered cautiously to cardiac patients, especially those with associated arrhythmias, coronary insufficiency, or myocardial ischemia.",

    "Pharmacology": "Undenatured Type II collagen: Undenatured Type II collagen is a nutritional supplement derived from chicken sternum cartilage using a patented, low-temperature, non-enzymatic manufacturing process that preserves the natural triple helix molecular configuration and its biological activity. Undenatured Type II collagen has unique mechanism of action. Undenatured Type II collagen molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes o f Undenatured Type II collagen interact with Peyer\u2019s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine and it transforms T-cells into T regulatory cells. T regulatory cells then migrate to joint area and secrete anti-inflammatory mediators (cytokines), including the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Thus it reduces joint inflammation and promotes cartilage repair. According to ORSI (osteoarthritis research society international), oral administration of Undenatured Type II collagen diminished deterioration of articular cartilage of osteoarthritis (OA). Glucosamine sulfate: Glucosamine sulfate is a natural supplement. It is a sugar protein that helps to build cartilage. Glucosamine, a normal constituent of glycosaminoglycans in cartilage matrix and synovial fluid, could have various pharmacological actions in articular cartilage and joint tissues. In randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, long-term administration of Glucosamine sulphate can prevent joint structure changes in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee with a significant improvement in symptoms.Boswellia serrata: This plant extract promotes joint health by inhibiting inflammatory factors such as the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzyme and leukotriene B4, which affect aging joints. Extract of Boswellia serrata have been clinically studied for osteoarthritis, joint function & joint pain. Boswellia may also help reduce cartilage damage in arthritis. In a placebo-controlled clinical study, Boswellia extract improves signs of joint discomfort in just 8 weeks. Boswellia serrata as a promising alternative to NSAIDs.Boron (calcium fructoborate): It is a patented complex of calcium, fructose & boron found naturally in fresh and dried fruits, vegetables and herbs. Calcium fructoborate significantly reduces the C-reactive protein in humans. This unique plant-mineral complex is contribute to bone health by controlling the inflammation associated with loss of bone mineral density.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Ursodeoxycholic Acid is a naturally occurring bile acid used to treat different hepatobilliary disorders. The activity of Ursodeoxycholic Acid is achieved through a decrease in secretion of cholesterol in bile. Ursodeoxycholic Acid achieves this through a few mechanisms: it reduces cholesterol absorption, suppresses liver cholesterol synthesis and it does not inhibit bile acid synthesis.Therefore, alters bile composition from supersaturated to unsaturated. Ursodeoxycholic Acid also promotes the formation of liquid cholesterol crystal complexes which enhance removal of the cholesterol from the gallbladder into the intestine to be expelled. Ursodeoxycholic Acid improves cholestatic liver diseases by-\n\nProtecting cholangiocytes against cytotoxicity of hydrophobic bile acids\nStimulating hepatobilliary secretion\nProtecting hepatocytes against bile acid-induced apoptosis\n\r\nUrsodeoxycholic Acid is completely absorbed in the upper intestine. Time to peak serum concentration varies from 30 to 150 minutes. The rate of absorption ranges from 60-80%.

This dose should be reduced according to creatinine clearance.The duration of treatment will usually be 90 days, but may need to be extended in high-risk patients.",
    "Interaction": "The combination of Valacyclovir with nephrotoxic medicinal products should be made with caution, especially in subjects with impaired renal function, and warrants regular monitoring of renal function. This applies to concomitant administration with aminoglycosides, organoplatinum compounds, iodinated contrast media, methotrexate, pentamidine, foscarnet, ciclosporin, and tacrolimus. Aciclovir is eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine via active renal tubular secretion. Following 1000mg Valacyclovir, cimetidine and probenecid reduce aciclovir renal clearance and increase the AUC of aciclovir by about 25% and 45%, respectively, by inhibition of the active renal secretion of aciclovir. Cimetidine and probenecid taken together with Valacyclovir increased aciclovir AUC by about 65%. Other medicinal products (including e.g. tenofovir) administered concurrently that compete with or inhibit active tubular secretion may increase aciclovir concentrations by this mechanism. Similarly, Valacyclovir administration may increase plasma concentrations of the concurrently administered substance. In patients receiving higher aciclovir exposures from Valacyclovir, caution is required during concurrent administration with drugs which inhibit active renal tubular secretion. Increases in plasma AUCs of aciclovir and of the inactive metabolite of mycophenolatemotefil have been shown when the drugs are co-administered. No changes in peak concentrations or AUCs are observed with co-administration of Valacyclovir and mycophenolatemofetil in healthy volunteers. There is limited clinical experience with the use of this combination.",

Psychiatric and nervous system disorders: Dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, decreased concentrations, tremor, agitation, ataxia, dysarthria, convulsions, encephalopathy, coma, psychotic symptoms. Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea. Gastrointestinal disorders: Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort. Hepato-biliary disorders: Reversible increases in liver function tests. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rashes including photosensitivity, pruritus, urticaria. Renal system disorders: Renal pain, renal impairment (especially in elderly patients or in patients with renal impairment receiving higher than the recommended doses). Renal pain may be associated with renal failure.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "A limited amount of data on the use of Valacyclovir and a moderate amount of data on the use of aciclovir in pregnancy is available from pregnancy registries and postmarketing experience indicate no malformative or foeto/neonatal toxicity. Animal studies do not show reproductive toxicity for Valacyclovir. Valacyclovir should only be used in pregnancy if the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk. Use in lactation: Aciclovir, the principle metabolite of Valacyclovir, is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses of Valacyclovir, no effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated since the dose ingested by the child is less than 2% of the therapeutic dose of intravenous aciclovir for treatment of neonatal herpes. Valacyclovir should be used with caution during breast feeding and only when clinically indicated.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hydration status: Care should be taken to ensure adequate fluid intake in patients who are at risk of dehydration, particularly the elderly.Use in patients with renal impairment and in elderly patients:\u00a0Aciclovir is eliminated by renal clearance; therefore the dose of Valacyclovir must be reduced in patients with renal impairment. Elderly patients are likely to have reduced renal function and therefore the need for dose reduction must be considered in this group of patients. Both elderly patients and patients with renal impairment are at increased risk of developing neurological side-effects and should be closely monitored for evidence of these effects. In the reported cases, these reactions were generally reversible on discontinuation of treatment.Use of higher dose of Valacyclovir in hepatic impairment and liver transplantation:\u00a0There are no data available on the use of higher doses of Valacyclovir (4000mg or more per day) in patients with liver disease. Specific studies of Valacyclovir have not been conducted in liver transplantation, and hence caution should be exercised when administering daily doses greater than 4000mg to these patients.Use for zoster treatment:\u00a0Clinical response should be closely monitored, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Consideration should be given to intravenous antiviral therapy when response to oral therapy is considered insufficient. Patients with complicated herpes zoster, i.e. those with visceral involvement, disseminated zoster, motor neuropathies, encephalitis and cerebrovascular complications should be treated with intravenous antiviral therapy. Moreover, immunocom-promised patients with ophthalmic zoster or those with a high risk for disease dissemination and visceral organ involvement should be treated with intravenous antiviral therapy.Transmission of genital herpes:\u00a0Patients should be advised to avoid intercourse when symptoms are present even if treatment with an antiviral has been initiated.Use of ocular HSV infections:\u00a0Clinical response should be closely monitored in these patients. Consideration should be given to intravenous antiviral therapy when response to oral therapy is unlikely to be sufficient.Use in CMV infections:\u00a0Data on the efficacy of Valacyclovir from transplant patients at high risk of CMV disease indicate that Valacyclovir should only be used in these patients when safety concerns preclude the use of valganciclovir or ganciclovir. High dose Valacyclovir as required for CMV prophylaxis may result in more frequent adverse events than observed with lower doses administered for other indications. Patients should be closely monitored for changes in renal function, and doses adjusted accordingly.",

This prevents the reuptake and storage of monoamine neurotransmitters noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin in synaptic vesicles making them vulnerable to metabolism by cytosolic enzymes. The presynaptic release of monoamine neurotransmitters is decreased due to the lack of vesicles with packaged neurotransmitters ready for release into the synapse. Neither valbenazine nor its active metabolite exhibits significant off-target binding at dopamine, serotonin, or adrenaline receptors.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The initial dose is 40 mg once daily. After one week, increase the dose to the recommended dose of 80 mg once daily. Continuation of 40 mg once daily may be considered for some patients. Administer it orally with or without food.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant use of Valbenazine with MAOIs may increase the concentration of monoamine neurotransmitters in synapses, potentially leading to an increased risk of adverse reactions such as serotonin syndrome, or attenuated treatment effect of Valbenazine. Avoid concomi-tant use of Valbenazine with MAOIs. Concomitant use of Valbenazine with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure (Cmax and AUC) to valbenazine and its active metabolite compared with the use of valbenazine alone. Reduce the dose when valbenazine is co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Consider reducing the dose based on tolerability when valbenazine is coadministered with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers with valbenazine is not recommended. Digoxin concentrations should be monitored when co-administering valbenazine with digoxin. Increased digoxin exposure may increase the risk of exposure related adverse reactions.",

    "Side Effects": "Somnolence, QT Prolongation",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The limited available data on Valbenazine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. A woman should not breastfeed during treatment with valbenazine and for 5 days after the final dose.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Valbenazine can cause somnolence. May impair the patient's ability to drive or operate hazardous machinery. Valbenazine may prolong the QT interval. For patients who are CYP2D6-poor metabolizers or are taking a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, dose reduction may be necessary. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhyth\u00admias associated with a prolonged QT interval.

By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.",

Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released in the corpus cavernosum & activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in an erection. Inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dose: 10 mg once daily, taken orally approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. The dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg based on efficacy and side effects. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. Vardenafil can be taken with or without food.Geriatrics: A starting dose of 5 mg should be considered in patients >65 years of age.Renal impaired patients: In patients with renal impairment, no dose adjustment is required.Hepatic impaired patients: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended and the maximum dose should not exceed 10 mg. Do not use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.",
    "Interaction": "Vardenafil can potentiate the blood pressure lowering effect of antihypertensive agents. In clinical studies, single doses of Vardenafil 20 mg caused a mean decrease in blood pressure of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic. Caution should be taken when co-administered with other vasodilators including alpha blockers. Vardenafil does not potentiate the hypotensive effect of alcohol. CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, indinavir, ritonavir and erythromycin) may reduce Vardenafil excretion from body",
    "Contraindications": "Administration of Vardenafil with nitrates (either regularly or intermittently) and nitric oxide donors is contraindicated because Vardenafil may potentiate hypotensive effect of nitrates.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Varenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at \u03b14\u03b22 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The efficacy of Varenicline in smoking cessation is believed to be the result of varenicline's activity at \u03b14\u03b22 sub-type of the nicotinic receptor where its binding produces agonist activity, while simultaneously preventing nicotine binding to these receptors.Electrophysiology studies\u00a0in vitro\u00a0and neurochemical studies\u00a0in vivo\u00a0have shown that varenicline binds to \u03b14\u03b22 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Varenicline blocks the ability of nicotine to activate \u03b14\u03b22 receptors and thus to stimulate the central nervous mesolimbic dopamine system, believed to be the neuronal mechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly selective and binds more potently to \u03b14\u03b22 receptors than to other common nicotinic receptors (>500-fold \u03b13\u03b24, >3,500-fold \u03b17, >20,000-fold \u03b11\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4), or to non-nicotinic receptors and transporters (>2,000-fold). Varenicline also binds with moderate affinity (Ki = 350 nM) to the 5-HT3 receptor.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Begin Varenicline dosing one week before the date set by the patient to stop smoking. Alternatively, the patient can begin Varenicline dosing and then quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment.Starting Week: 0.5 mg once daily on days 1-3 and 0.5 mg twice daily on days 4-7.Continuing Weeks: 1 mg twice daily for a total of 12 weeks.An additional 12 weeks of treatment is recommended for successful quitters to increase likelihood of long-term abstinence.Consider a gradual approach to quitting smoking with Varenicline for patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should begin Varenicline dosing and reduce smoking by 50% from baseline within the first four weeks, by an additional 50% in the next four weeks, and continue reducing with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. Continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks.Severe Renal Impairment (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min): Begin with 0.5 mg once daily and titrate to 0.5 mg twice daily. For patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, a maximum of 0.5 mg daily may be given if tolerated.Consider dose reduction for patients who cannot tolerate adverse effects.Another attempt at treatment is recommended for those who fail to stop smoking or relapse when factors contributing to the failed attempt have been addressed.Provide patients with appropriate educational materials and counseling to support the quit attempt.\u00a0Pediatric Use: Varenicline is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger because its efficacy in this population was not demonstrated.",
    "Interaction": "Other Smoking Cessation Therapies: Safety and efficacy in combination with other smoking cessation therapies has not been established. Coadministration of varenicline and transdermal nicotine resulted in a high rate of discontinuation due to adverse events.\u00a0Effect of Smoking Cessation on Other Drugs: Pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain drugs (e.g., theophylline, warfarin, insulin) may be altered, necessitating dose adjustment.",

    "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions (>5% and twice the rate seen in placebo-treated patients) were nausea, abnormal (e.g., vivid, unusual, or strange) dreams, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Available data have not suggested an increased risk for major birth defects following exposure to varenicline in pregnancy, compared with women who smoke. Smoking during pregnancy is associated with maternal, fetal, and neonatal risks. There are no data on the presence of varenicline in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies varenicline was present in milk of lactating rats.",

Observe patients attempting to quit smoking with Varenicline for the occurrence of such symptoms and instruct them to discontinue Varenicline and contact a healthcare provider if they experience such adverse events.Seizures: New or worsening seizures have been observed in patients taking Varenicline. Varenicline should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other factors that can lower the seizure threshold.Interaction with Alcohol: Increased effects of alcohol have been reported. Instruct patients to reduce the amount of alcohol they consume until they know whether Varenicline affects them.Accidental Injury: Accidental injuries (e.g., traffic accidents) have been reported. Instruct patients to use caution driving or operating machinery until they know how Varenicline may affect them.Cardiovascular Events: Patients with underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease may be at increased risk of CV events; however, these concerns must be balanced with the health benefits of smoking cessation. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare providers of new or worsening CV symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke.Somnambulism: Cases of somnambulism have been reported in patients taking Varenicline. Some cases described harmful behavior to self, others, or property. Instruct patients to discontinue Varenicline and notify their healthcare provider if they experience somnambulism.Angioedema and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Such reactions, including angioedema, infrequently life-threatening, have been reported.

    "Indications": "Vasopressin injection is used for:\n\nVasopressin injection is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with vasodilatory shock.\nVasopressin as an early adjunct to norepinephrine for patients with septic shock could be beneficial to patient outcomes.\nPost-cardiotomy shock\nSeptic shock.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "In the kidneys, vasopressin acts on the V2 receptors located on the cells of the collecting ducts. This binding stimulates the insertion of aquaporin water channels into the membranes of these cells, which enhances water reabsorption back into the bloodstream. This reduces urine output and helps maintain body water balance. This mechanism is beneficial in conditions such as diabetes insipidus, where water retention is impaired.Pharmacokinetics:\n\nOn set of action :1-2 min\nHalf-life 20 to 30 minutes.\nExcretion Vasopressin is predominantly metabolized and only about 6% of the dose is excreted unchanged into urine.\n\r\nVasopressin injection is a synthetic form of the natural antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. It is primarily involved in regulating the body\u2019s water balance, controlling water reabsorption in the kidneys, and also acting as a vasoconstrictor to help regulate blood pressure. The medication is used in various medical situations, including diabetes insipidus, shock states, and certain bleeding disorders.Vasopressin Injection USP is typically available as a clear, colorless solution for intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), or subcutaneous (SC) injection.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "0.01 - 0.03 Units/Min.Dilute 20 units/mL single-dose vial contents with normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) or 5% dextrose in water (D5W) to either 0.1 units/mL or 1 unit/mL for intravenous administration. Discard unused diluted solution after 18 hours at room temperature or 24 hours under refrigeration.Post-cardiotomy shock: 0.03 to 0.1 units/minute. (The recommended starting dose)Septic shock: 0.01 to 0.07 units/minute. (The recommended starting dose)",
    "Interaction": "Lithium: Lithium may decrease the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin, requiring close monitoring if both are used concurrently.Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids may alter vasopressin's effects, especially regarding fluid and electrolyte balance.Other Vasopressors: Combining vasopressin with other vasopressors may result in an additive increase in blood pressure, requiring careful monitoring.Alcohol: Alcohol can counteract the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin, potentially leading to increased urine output.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity: Known hypersensitivity to vasopressin or any of its components.Chronic Renal Failure: In cases of severe renal disease or where fluid retention is contraindicated.Severe Hypertension: Vasopressin should be avoided in patients with significant hypertension unless there is an urgent need.Coronary Artery Disease: Caution in patients with coronary artery disease, as vasoconstriction can worsen ischemia.",
    "Side Effects": "Common Side Effects:\n\nHeadache\nNausea, vomiting\nAbdominal cramping\nIncreased blood pressure\nWater retention and hyponatremia (low sodium levels)\n\r\nSerious Side Effects:\n\nMyocardial ischemia or infarction: Due to vasoconstriction, especially in patients with pre-existing heart disease.\nSevere hyponatremia: Can lead to water intoxication, seizures, and altered mental status.\nArrhythmias: Increased risk of arrhythmias due to fluid shifts and electrolyte imbalances.\nGangrene: If extravasation occurs during infusion, tissue necrosis may develop at the injection site.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy (Category C): Use only if the benefits justify the risks.\u00a0There are no adequate studies in pregnant women. Vasopressin should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Caution is advised when considering its use in pregnant patients.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Electrolyte Imbalance: Close monitoring of electrolytes is required, particularly for sodium levels. Excessive water retention can lead to hyponatremia, which can cause seizures, coma, or even death.Vasopressin-Induced Ischemia: Because of its vasoconstrictor properties, vasopressin should be used cautiously in patients with ischemic conditions (e.g., coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease).Extravasation Risk: When administered intravenously, extravasation (leakage of the drug into surrounding tissues) should be avoided, as it can lead to necrosis and other serious tissue damage.",

    "Indications": "Vecuronium Bromide is indicated as an adjunct to general anaesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Vecuronium Bromide is a preparation of Vecuronium Bromide. It is a Lyophilized powder for injection. It is a non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent. Vecuronium Bromide blocks the transmission process between the motor nerve-ending and striated muscle by binding competitively with acetylcholine to the nicotinic receptors located in the motor end-plate region of striated muscle.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "Succinylcholine: Prior administration of succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effect of Vecuronium and its duration of action. If succinylcholine is used before Vecuronium, the administration of Vecuronium should be delayed until the succinylcholine effect shows signs of wearing off. With succinylcholine as the intubating agent, initial doses of 0.04 to 0.06 mg/kg of vecuronium may be administered to produce complete neuromuscular block with clinical duration of action of 25 to 30 minutes. Other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (pancuronium, d-tubocurarine, metocurine and gallamine) act in the same fashion as does Vecuronium; therefore, these drugs and Vecuronium may manifest an additive effect when used together. Inhalation Anesthetics: Use of volatile inhalational anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, and halothane with Vecuronium will enhance neuromuscular blockade. Antibiotics: Parenteral/intraperitoneal administration of high doses of certain antibiotics may intensify or produce a neuromuscular block on their own. The following antibiotics have been associated with various degrees of paralysis: aminoglycosides (such as neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and dihydrostreptomycin); tetracyclines; bacitracin; polymyxin B; colistin; and sodium colistimethate. If these or other newly introduced antibiotics are used in conjunction with vecuronium during surgery, unexpected prolongation of neuromuscular block should be considered a possibility. Other: Experience concerning injection of quinidine during recovery from use of other muscle relaxants suggests that recurrent paralysis may occur. This possibility must also be considered for vecuronium. Vecuronium induced neuromuscular blockade has been counteracted by alkalosis and enhanced by acidosis in experimental animals (cat). Electrolyte imbalance and diseases which lead to electrolyte imbalance, such as adrenal cortical insufficiency, have been shown to alter neuromuscular blockade. Depending on the nature of the imbalance, either enhancement or inhibition may be expected. Magnesium salts, administered for the management of toxemia of pregnancy, may enhance neuromuscular blockade.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to vecuronium or the bromide ion or any of the excipients of vecuronium.",
    "Side Effects": "Vecuronium Bromide is a non-depolarising muscle relaxants, has an intermediate duration of action. It does not generally produce histamine release and lacks cardiovascular effects. The common side effects of non-depolarising muscle relaxants are skin flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, bronchospasm and very rarely, anaphylactoid reactions. Acute myopathy has also been reported after prolonged use in intensive care.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are insufficient data on the use of Vecuronium during animal or human Pregnancy to assess potential harm to the foetus. Vecuronium should be given to a pregnant woman only when the attending physician decides that the benefits outweigh the risks. There are no human data on the use of Vecuronium during lactation. Vecuronium should be given to lactating women only when the attending physician decides that the benefits outweigh the risks. Caesarean section: Studies with Vecuronium, administered in doses up to 0.1 mg/kg, have shown its safety for use in caesarean section. In caesarean section the dose should not exceed 0.1 mg/kg. In several clinical studies Vecuronium did not affect Apgar score, foetal muscle tonus or cardio respiratory adaptation. From umbilical cord blood sampling it is apparent that only very little placental transfer of vecuronium occurs which did not lead to the observation of any clinical adverse effect in the newborn.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents has been reported; caution is advised in cases of hypersensitivity to these drugs. Their activity is prolonged in patients with myasthenia gravis and in hypothermia, therefore lower doses are required. Non-depolarising muscle relaxants should be used with great care in those with other neuromuscular disorders and those with fluid and electrolyte disturbances, as response is unpredictable. Resistance may develop in patients with burns who may require increased doses; low plasma cholinesterase activity in these patients requires dose titration for mivacurium. General: Vecuronium should be administered in carefully adjusted dosage by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and the possible complications that might occur following its use. The drug should not be administered unless facilities for intubation, artificial respiration, oxygen therapy, and reversal agents are immediately available. The clinician must be prepared to assist or control respiration. A peripheral nerve stimulator should be employed to monitor drug response, need for additional relaxant, and adequacy of spontaneous recovery or anticholinesterase antagonism.Intensive Care Unit: To reduce the possibility of prolonged neuromuscular blockade and other complications that might occur following long-term use in the ICU, Vecuronium or any other neuromuscular blocking agent should be administered in carefully adjusted doses by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate peripheral nerve stimulator muscle monitoring techniques.Neuromuscular Disease: In patients who are known to have myasthenia gravis or the myasthenic syndrome, small doses of Vecuronium may have profound effects. In such patients, a peripheral nerve stimulator and use of a small test dose may be of particular value in assessing and monitoring dosage requirements.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Venetoclax is a selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, an antiapoptotic protein. Overexpression of BCL-2 has been demonstrated in CLL cells where it mediates tumor cell survival and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. Venetoclax helps restore the process of apoptosis by binding directly to the BCL-2 protein, displacing pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM, triggering mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the activation of caspases. In nonclinical studies, venetoclax has demonstrated cytotoxic activity in tumor cells that overexpress BCL-2.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The starting dose is 20 mg of Venetoclax once daily for 7 days. The dose must be gradually increased over a period of 5 weeks up to the daily dose of 400 mg. The 5-week dose-titration schedule is designed to gradually reduce tumour burden (debulk) and decrease the risk of tumor lysis syndrome.Post-titration dose for Venetoclax in combination with Rituximab: The recommended dose of Venetoclax in combination with Rituximab is 400 mg once daily. Rituximab should be administered after the patient has completed the dose-titration schedule and has received the recommended daily dose of 400 mg Venetoclax for 7 days. Venetoclax should be taken for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of Rituximab.Post-titration dose for Venetoclax monotherapy: The recommended dose of Venetoclax is 400 mg once daily. Treatment should be continued until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the patient.",
    "Interaction": "CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of 400 mg once daily ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitor, for 7 days in 11 previously treated patients with NHL increased Venetoclax Cmax by 2.3-fold and AUC by 6.4-fold. Co-administration of 50 mg once daily ritonavir, a strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor, for 14 days in 6 healthy subjects increased Venetoclax Cmax by 2.4-fold and AUC by 7.9-fold. Co-administration of Venetoclax with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is predicted to increase Venetoclax AUC by on average 5.8- to 7.8-fold. Concomitant use of Venetoclax with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) at initiation and during the dose-titration phase is contraindicated due to increased risk for TLS.At initiation and during the dose-titration phase, concomitant use of Venetoclax with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil) should be avoided. Alternative treatments should be considered. If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, the initiation dose of Venetoclax and the doses for the titration phase should be reduced by at least 50%. Patients should be monitored more closely for signs and symptoms of TLS.For patients who have completed the dose-titration phase and are on a steady daily dose of Venetoclax, the Venetoclax dose should be reduced by 50% when used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A inhibitors and by 75% when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Patients should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicities and the dose may need to be further adjusted. The Venetoclax dose that was used prior to initiating the CYP3A inhibitor should be resumed 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of the inhibitor. Grapefruit products, Seville oranges, and starfruit (carambola) should be avoided during treatment with Venetoclax as they contain inhibitors of CYP3A.P-gp and BCRP inhibitors: Venetoclax is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP , Co-administration of a 600 mg single dose of rifampin, a P-gp inhibitor, in 11 healthy subjects increased Venetoclax Cmax by 106% and AUC by 78%. Concomitant use of Venetoclax with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase should be avoided; if a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor must be used, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicities.CYP3A inducers: Co-administration of 600 mg once daily rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, for 13 days in 10 healthy subjects decreased Venetoclax Cmax by 42% and AUC\u00b0\u00b0 by 71%. Concomitant use of Venetoclax with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) should be avoided. Alternative treatments with less CYP3A induction should be considered. Preparations containing St. John's wort are contraindicated during treatment with Venetoclax, as efficacy may be reduced.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase. Concomitant use of preparations containing St. John's wort",
    "Side Effects": "The most commonly occurring side effects (>20%) of any grade in patients receiving Venetoclax in the combination study with Rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract infection. In the monotherapy studies, the most common side effects were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection. The most frequently reported serious side effects (>2%) in patients receiving Venetoclax in combination with Rituximab were pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, and TLS. In the monotherapy studies, the most frequently reported serious side effects (>2%) were pneumonia and febrile neutropenia.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females: Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking Venetoclax and for at least 30 days after ending treatment. Therefore, women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive measures while taking Venetoclax and for 30 days after stopping treatment. It is currently unknown whether Venetoclax may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method.Pregnancy: Based on embryo-foetal toxicity studies in animals, Venetoclax may harm the fetus when administered to pregnant women. There is no adequate and well-controlled data from the use of Venetoclax in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Venetoclax is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using highly effective contraception.Breast-feeding: It is unknown whether Venetoclax or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-feeding child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Venetoclax.Fertility: No human data on the effect of Venetoclax on fertility are available. Based on testicular toxicity in dogs at clinically relevant exposures, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Venetoclax. Before starting treatment, counselling on sperm storage may be considered in some male patients.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Tumour lysis syndrome: Tumour lysis syndrome, including fatal events, has occurred in patients with previously treated CLL with high tumour burden when treated with Venetoclax. Venetoclax can cause rapid reduction in tumour, and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-weeks dose-titration phase. Changes in electrolytes consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of Venetoclax and at each dose increase. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including comorbidities. Patients with high tumour burden (e.g., any lymph node with a diameter >5 cm or high ALC >25 x 109/1) are at greater risk of TLS when initiating enetoclax. Reduced renal function (CrCI <80 ml/min) further increases the risk. Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis for TLS, including hydration and anti-hyperuricaemics. Blood chemistries should be monitored and abnormalities managed promptly. Dosing should be interrupted if needed. More intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization) should be employed as overall risk increases. The instructions for \"Prevention of tumour lysis syndrome\" should be followed. Concomitant use of this medicinal product with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors increases Venetoclax exposure and may increase the risk for TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration phase. Also, inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP may increase Venetoclax exposure.Neutropenia: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia has been reported in patients treated with Venetoclax in the combination study with Rituximab (G028667/MURANO) and in the monotherapy studies. Complete blood counts should be monitored throughout the treatment period. Dose interruptions or reductions are recommended for patients with severe neutropenia. Serious infections including events of sepsis with fatal outcome have been reported. Supportive measures including antimicrobials for any signs of infection should be considered.Immunization: The safety and efficacy of immunization with live attenuated vaccines during or following Venetoclax therapy have not been studied. Live vaccines should not be administered during treatment and thereafter until B-cell recovery.CYP3A inducers: Co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased Venetoclax exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. Concomitant use of Venetoclax with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided.Women of childbearing potential: Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception while taking Venetoclax.",

When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger that plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone, and cardiac contractility, and cardiac remodeling. Heart failure is associated with impaired synthesis of NO and decreased activity of sGC, which may contribute to myocardial and vascular dysfunction. By directly stimulating sGC, independently of and synergistically with NO, vericiguat augments levels of intracellular cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended Starting Dose: The recommended starting dose of Vericiguat is 2.5 mg orally once daily with food. Double the dose of Vericiguat approximately every 2 weeks to reach the target maintenance dose of 10 mg once daily, as tolerated by the patient. For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablet, Vericiguat may be crushed and mixed with water immediately before administration or as directed by physician.Geriatric Patients: No dosage adjustment of Vericiguat is required in geriatric patients. No overall differences in safety or efficacy of Vericiguat were observed between patients aged 65 years and older compared to younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.Hepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment of Vericiguat is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.Renal Impairment: No dosage adjustment of Vericiguat is recommended in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u226515 mL/min/1.73m2 who are not on dialysis. Vericiguat has not been studied in patients with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2 at treatment initiation or on dialysis.Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Vericiguat have not been established in pediatric patients.",
    "Interaction": "Other Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulators: Vericiguat is contraindicated in patients with concomitant use of other soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators.PDE-5 Inhibitors: Concomitant use of Vericiguat with PDE-5 inhibitors is not recommended because of the potential for hypotension.With food & others: Vericiguat should be taken with food. The absolute bioavailability of Vericiguat is 93% when taken with food.",
    "Contraindications": "Vericiguat is contraindicated in patients with concomitant use of other soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators.",
    "Side Effects": "Common Side effects: The most common side effects of Vericiguat tablet include low blood pressure & low red blood cells (Anemia).",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Vericiguat is contraindicated in pregnancy because it may cause fetal harm. Exclude pregnancy before the start of treatment. To prevent pregnancy, females of reproductive potential must use effective forms of contraception during treatment and for one month after stopping treatment.Nursing Mothers: There are no data on the presence of Vericiguat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from Vericiguat, women should be advised not to breastfeed during treatment with Vericiguat.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Vericiguat should not be administered to a pregnant female because it may cause fetal harm. Obtain a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with Vericiguat. Pregnancy should be excluded before the start of treatment. To prevent pregnancy, females of reproductive potential must use effective forms of contraception during treatment and for one month after stopping treatment.",

    "Pharmacology": "This preparation contains both futicasone furoate and vilanterol, the mechanisms of action described below for the individual components. These drugs represent 2 diferent classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have diferent efects on clinical and physiological aspects. The pharmacologic efects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3, 5-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. The precise mechanism through which futicasone furoate afects COPD and asthma symptoms is not known. Infammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of COPD and asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in infammation.",

    "name": "Vilazodone Hydrochloride",
    "generic_id": "2068",
    "Indications": "Vilazodone Hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The mechanism of action of vilazodone in the treatment of major depressive disorder is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the CNS through selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake. Vilazodone is also a partial agonist at serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors; however, the net result of this action on serotonergic transmission and its role in vilazodone\u2019s antidepressant effect are unknown.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Dosage for Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: The recommended target dosage for vilazodone is 20 mg to 40 mg orally once daily with food. To achieve the target dosage, titrate vilazodone as follows:\n\nStart with an initial dosage of 10 mg once daily with food for 7 days,\nThen increase to 20 mg once daily with food.\nThe dose may be increased up to 40 mg once daily with food after a minimum of 7 days between dosage increases.\n\r\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. If it is almost time for the next dose, the patient should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Two doses should not be taken at the same time.Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting vilazodone: Prior to initiating treatment with vilazodone or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.Switching to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant: At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of vilazodone. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping vilazodone before starting an MAOI antidepressant.Dosage Adjustments with CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers:\n\nPatients receiving concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors: During concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), the vilazodone dose should not exceed 20 mg once daily. The original vilazodone dose level, can be resumed when the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued.\nPatients receiving concomitant CYP3A4 inducers: Based on clinical response, consider increasing the dosage of vilazodone by 2-fold, up to a maximum 80 mg once daily, over 1 to 2 weeks in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) for greater than 14 days. If CYP3A4 inducers are discontinued, gradually reduce the vilazodone dosage to its original level over 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nDiscontinuing Treatment with vilazodone: Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of vilazodone. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. vilazodone should be down tapered from the 40 mg once daily dose to 20 mg once daily for 4 days, followed by 10 mg once daily for 3 days. Patients taking vilazodone 20 mg once daily should be tapered to 10 mg once daily for 7 days.",
    "Interaction": "CYP3A4 Inhibitors: The vilazodone dose should not exceed 20 mg once daily when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider increasing vilazodone dosage by 2-fold, up to 80 mg once-daily over 1 to 2 weeks when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inducers for greater than 14 days).",
    "Contraindications": "Vilazodone is contraindicated in patients taking, or within 14 days of stopping, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.",
    "Side Effects": "Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults\nSerotonin Syndrome\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\nSeizures\nAngle-Closure Glaucoma\nHyponatremia\nSexual Dysfunction",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There are no data on the presence of vilazodone in human milk, the effects of vilazodone on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRI, SNRI, triptans, amphetamines), but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue vilazodone and initiate supportive treatment.Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may increase this risk.Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder.Seizures: Can occur with treatment. Use with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.Angle Closure Glaucoma: Avoid use of antidepressants, including vilazodone, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.Sexual Dysfunction: vilazodone may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/1125/vildagliptin": {
    "name": "Vildagliptin",
    "generic_id": "1125",
    "Indications": "Vildagliptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as monotherapy and in dual combination with Metformin, a Sulphonylurea, a Thiazolidinedione, or Insulin when diet, exercise and a single antidiabetic agent do not result in adequate glycemic control.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Vildagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of Vildagliptin is-\n\n50 mg or 100 mg daily for monotherapy.\n50 mg twice daily (morning and evening) when used in dual combination with Metformin or a Thiazolidinedione;\n50 mg once daily in the morning when used in dual combination with a Sulphonylurea.\n\r\nVildagliptin may be taken with or without a meal. No dosage adjustment is required in the elderly, or in patients with mild renal impairment.Pediatric use: Vildagliptin is not recommended in patients 18 years of age.",
    "Interaction": "In pharmacokinetic studies, no interactions were seen with pioglitazone, metformin, glibenclamide, digoxin, warfarin, amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan or simvastatin. As with other oral antidiabetic medicinal products the glucose-lowering effect of Vildagliptin may be reduced by certain active substances, including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products and sympathomimetics.",
    "Contraindications": "Vildagliptin is contraindicated in patients with:\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients\nPatients with moderate to severe renalImpairment\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment: patients with pre-treatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) >3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).\nPatients with type 1 diabetes",
    "Side Effects": "The majority of adverse reactions were mild and transient, not requiring treatment discontinuations. A rare case of hepatic dysfunction is seen. Clinical trials of up to and more than 2 years duration did not show any additional safety signals or unforeseen risks when using this combination.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Vildagliptin should not be used in pregnancy. Vildagliptin should not be used during lactation.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Caution should be exercised in patients aged 75 years and older due to limited clinical experience. It is recommended that LFTs are monitored prior to initiation of Vildagliptin, at three-monthly intervals in the first year and periodically thereafter. If transaminase levels are increased, patients should be monitored with a second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests until the abnormality returns to normal. If AST or ALT persists at 3xULN, Vildagliptin treatment should be stopped. Patients who develop jaundice or other signs of liver dysfunction should discontinue Vildagliptin. Following the withdrawal of treatment with Vildagliptin and LFT normalization, treatment with Vildagliptin should not be reinitiated. Due to limited clinical experience, use with caution in patients with congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I-II, and do not use in patients with NYHA functional class III IV.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/738/vildagliptin-metformin-hydrochloride": {
    "name": "Vildagliptin + Metformin Hydrochloride",
    "generic_id": "738",
    "Indications": "This tablet is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercises to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose diabetes is not adequately controlled on Metformin Hydrochloride or Vildagliptin alone or who are already treated with the combination of Vildagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride, as separate tablets.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Vildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase-4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). The administration of Vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, Vildagliptin increases insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and decreases glucagon secretion from alpha cell. The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to reduced glycaemia.Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Glucomin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: Based on the patient's current dose of Metformin, this combination may be initiated at twice daily, 1 tablet in the morning and the other in the evening. Patients receiving Vildagliptin and Metformin from separate tablets may be switched to this combination containing the same doses of each component. Doses higher than 100 mg of vildagliptin are not recommended. There is no clinical experience of Vildagliptin and Metformin in triple combination with other antidiabetic agents. Taking this combination with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Metformin.",
    "Interaction": "No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when Vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) was co-administered with Metformin Hydrochloride (1,000 mg once daily). Vildagliptin has a low potential for drug interactions. Since Vildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate nor does it inhibit nor induces CYP 450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with co-medications that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes. As a result of these studies no clinically relevant interactions with other oral antidiabetics (glibenclamide, pioglitazone, metformin hydrochloride), amlodipine, digoxin, ramipril, simvastatin, valsartan or warfarin were observed after co-administration with vildagliptin. On the other hand, furosemide, nifedipine and glyburide increase Cmax and blood AUC of Metformin with no change in renal clearance of Metformin.",
    "Contraindications": "This combination is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vildagliptin or Metformin Hydrochloride or to any of the excipients. It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, and septicaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure patients and in patients with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. It should be temporarily discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials, because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects are headache, tremor, dizziness, nausea, hypoglycaemia etc.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women and therefore, this combination should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\u00a0No studies have been conducted with the components of this combination. As it is not known whether Vildagliptin and/or Metformin Hydrochloride is excreted in human milk this combination should not be administered to breast-feeding women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Lactic acidosis can occur due to Metformin accumulation. If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be hospitalized immediately. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least once a year in patients with normal renal function and 2\u20134 times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of normal and in elderly patients. Special caution should be exercised in elderly patients where renal function may become impaired (e.g. when initiating antihypertensives, diuretics or NSAIDs). It is recommended that Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are monitored prior to initiation of this drug, at three-monthly intervals in the first year and periodically thereafter. If transaminase levels are increased, patients should be monitored with a second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests until the abnormality return to normal. If AST or ALT persist at 3 x ULN, Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets should be stopped Patients who develop jaundice or other signs of liver dysfunction. Following withdrawal of treatment with Vildagliptin & Metformin and LFT normalization, treatment with Vildagliptin & Metformin should not be reinitiated. Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets should be discontinued 48 hours before elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 hours afterwards.",

Read moreVinblastine Sulfate is a cytotoxic drug that arrests cell growth at the metaphase. Its actions are more pronounced on the rapidly dividing cell than on the normal cell. It appears to act, like vincristine, by binding to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, preventing polymerisation.Information available at present suggests that Vinblastine Sulfate may be useful, either alone or in combination with other oncolytic drugs, for the treatment of: Hodgkin\u2019s disease; nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma; carcinoma of the breast; methotrexate-resistant choriocarcinoma; renal cell carcinoma; testicular teratoma and seminoma; histiocytosis X. Other neoplasms occasionally show a marked response to Vinblastine sulphate, but less frequently than the more susceptible conditions listed above.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Although the mechanism of action has not been definitely established, VinBLAStine appears to bind to or crystallise critical microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, thus preventing their proper polymerisation and causing metaphase arrest. In high concentrations, Vinblastine also exerts complex effects on nucleic acid and protein synthesis. Vinblastine reportedly also interferes with amino acid metabolism by blocking cellular utilisation of glutamic acid and thus inhibits purine synthesis, the citric acid cycle, and the formation of urea. Vinblastine exerts some immunosuppressive activity.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose for adults, the elderly and children is 6 mg/m2 , usually administered no more frequently than once every seven days. For testicular tumours, the dosage may be increased to 0.2 mg/kg administered on each of two consecutive days every three weeks. To minimise the possibility of extravascular spillage, it is suggested that the mini-bag infusion and needle be rinsed with venous blood before withdrawal. The dose should not be diluted in large volumes of diluent (ie, 100 to 250 ml) or given intravenously for prolonged periods (ranging from 30 to 60 minutes or more), since this frequently results in irritation of the vein and increases the chance of extravasation. Because of the enhanced possibility of thrombosis, it is considered inadvisable to inject a solution of VinBLAStine sulphate into an extremity in which the circulation is impaired, or potentially impaired, by such conditions as compressing or invading neoplasm, phlebitis or varicosity.",
    "Interaction": "Possible increase in vinblastine levels with aprepitant. Reduced vinblastine metabolism with miconazole. Variable interactions with phenytoin, monitor serum phenytoin levels. Reduced immune response with vaccines. Additive myelotoxicity with zidovudine. Concurrent admin of vinblastine with CYP3A inhibitors may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of side effects.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.For intravenous use only. Fatal if given by other routes.Vinblastine Sulfate is contraindicated in patients who are leucopenic.Vinblastine Sulfate should not be used in the presence of bacterial infection. Such infections should be brought under control with antiseptics or antibiotics before the initiation of therapy with Vinblastine Sulfate.",
    "Side Effects": "Alopecia, constipation, malaise, stomatitis, dose-limiting bone marrow suppression (e.g. granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia), hypertension, central and peripheral neurotoxicity, 8th cranial nerve damage resulting in vestibular and auditory toxicity, ischaemic cardiac toxicity, breathlessness, bone, tumour or jaw pain. Nausea, vomiting, GI bleed, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. Necrosis, cellulitis if extravasation occurs.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Although information on the use of Vinblastine during pregnancy is limited, the drug may cause foetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women. The drug causes resorption of foetuses in animals and produces gross foetal abnormalities in surviving offspring. There are no adequate and controlled studies to date using Vinblastine in pregnant women, and the drug should be used during pregnancy only in life-threatening situations or severe disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving the drug. If Vinblastine is administered during pregnancy or the patient becomes pregnant while receiving the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus.Breast-feeding: It is not known whether Vinblastine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential forserious adverse reactions due to Vinblastine in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hepatic impairment; neurotoxicity; ischemic heart disease; preexisting pulmonary dysfunction; extravasation may cause tissue damage and pain. Discontinue immediately if extravasation occurs, with local Inj of hyaluronidase and local heat application to decrease discomfort and risk of cellulitis; remaining Inj to be injected into another vein. Routine prophylaxis against constipation recommended especially in high doses. Nadir in leukocyte count occur 4-10 days after vinblastine admin; recovery observed 7-14 days after treatment.",

    "name": "Vincristine Sulfate",
    "generic_id": "1127",
    "Indications": "Vincristine sulfate is indicated in acute leukemia. Vincristine sulfate has also been shown to be useful in combination with other oncolytic agents in Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas (lymphocytic, mixed-cell, histiocytic, undifferentiated, nodular, and diffuse types), rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms' tumor.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Vincristine Sulfate is the salt of an alkaloid obtained from the periwinkle plant (Vinca rasea Linn). Vincristine sulfate is a white or slightly yellow, hygroscopic, amorphous or crystalline powder and is freely soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with cancer have shown a triphasic serum decay pattern following rapid intravenous injection. The initial. middle, and terminal half-lives are 5 minutes, 2.3 hours and 85 hours respectively; however the range of the terminal half-life in humans is from 19 to 155 hours. The liver is the major excretory organ in humans and animals; about 80% of an injected dose of vincristine sulfate appears in the faeces and 10% to 20% can be found in the urine. Within 15 to 30 minutes after injection, over 90% of the drug is distributed from the blood into tissue, where it remains tightly, but not irreversibly, bound.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Extreme care must be used in calculating and administering the dose of vincristine, since overdosage may have a very serious or fatal outcome. The drug is given i.v. at weekly intervals. Fatal if given intrathecally. Adults: The usual dose of vincristine is 1.4 mg/m2. Children: The usual dose of vincristine is 1.5-2 mg/m2. For children weighing 10 kg or less, the initial dose of vincristine should be 0.05 mg/kg once a week, with careful increasing of dosing thereafter based on effects. Vincristine should not be administered to patients receiving radiation therapy through ports that include the liver. When vincristine is used in combination with L-asparaginase, it should be given 12 to 24 hours prior to administration of the enzyme in order to minimize toxicity because L-asparaginase may reduce hepatic clearance of vincristine. Or, as directed by the registered physician.Administration: Vincristine solution may be injected either directly into a vein or into the tubing of an i.g. infusion. Injection of the solution may be completed in about 1 minute. Further dilution: The solution may be further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 0.5% dextrose injection if desired.",
    "Interaction": "Allopurinol may increase the incidence of cytotoxic induced bone-marrow depression. The mechanism for this potentiation has not been fully classified. The neurotoxicity of vincristine may be additive with that of asparaginase isoniazid and other drugs acting on the peripheral nervous system. The concurrent use of doxorubicin with vincristine and prednisone may produce increased myelosuppression; it is recommended that the combination be avoided. Vincristine appears to increase the cellular uptake of methotrexate by malignant cells and this principle has been applied in high-dose methotrexate therapy.",
    "Contraindications": "Patients with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome should not be given vincristine sulfate. Vincristine should not be administered to patients while they are receiving radiation therapy through ports that include the liver. Patients with known hypersensitivity to vinca alkaloids or mannitol should not be given vincristine sulfate.",
    "Side Effects": "Prior to the use of this drug, patients and or parents/guardians should be advised of the possibility of untoward symptoms. In general, adverse reactions are reversible and are related to dosage. The most common adverse reaction is hair loss, the most troublesome adverse reactions are neuromuscular in origin. The following adverse reactions have been reported: Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of allergic-type reactions, such as anaphylaxis, rash, and oedema, that are temporarily related to vincristine therapy have been reported in patients receiving vincristine as a part of multidrug chemotherapy regimens. Gastrointestinal: Autonomic toxicity such as constipation and paralytic ileus are not uncommon and are frequently associated with abdominal cramps. Stool softeners, mild laxatives and enemas may be helpful. A routine prophylactic regimen of laxative and enemas is usually recommended for patients receiving vincristine. Constipation may take the form of upper colon impaction, and on physical examination, the rectum may be empty. Colicky abdominal pain coupled with an empty rectum may mislead the physician. Genitourinary Hyperuricaemia: It may occur in some patients receiving vincristine, especially those with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or leukaemia. In some patients uric acid nephropathy may result. These effects may be minimised by adequate hydration, alkalinisation of the urine and/or administration of allopurinol. Polyuria, dysuria, and urinary retention due to bladder atony have occurred.Cardiovascular: Hypertension and hypotension have occurred. Chemotherapy combinations that have included vincristine sulfate, when given to patients previously treated with mediastinal radiation, have been associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Causality has not been established.Neurologic: Frequently, there is a sequence to the development of neuromuscular side effects. Initially, only sensory impairment and paraesthesiae may be encountered. With continued treatment, neuritic pain and later, motor difficulties may occur. There have been no reports made of any agent that can reverse the neuromuscular manifestations that may accompany therapy with vincristine. Other: Fever and headache have occurred. Also other side effects include defective sweating, myoclonic jerks, abnormal Vasalva response, impotence and diminished libido. Weight loss has been reported at high doses.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category D. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant woman Vincristine has been reported to be found in human milk. Patient recieves Vincristine should not be breast feed.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "It is extremely important to be certain that the needle is properly positioned in the vein before any vincristine is injected. If leakage into the surrounding tissue should occur during i.v. administration of vincristine, it may cause considerable irritation. The injection should be discontinued immediately, and any remaining portion of the dose should then be introduced into another vein. Local injection of hyaluronidase and the application of moderate heat to the area of leakage help disperse the drug and are thought to minimize discomfort and the possibility of cellulitis. Vincristine should be used only by physicians experienced in cytotoxic chemotherapy.The drug is very irritating and should not be given intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intrathecally. Intrathecal administration of vincristine is usually fatal. Treatment of patients following accidental intrathecal administration of vincristine has included immediate removal of spinal fluid and flushing with Lactated Ringer's solution, as well as other solutions and has not prevented ascending paralysis and death. In one case, progressive paralysis in an adult was arrested by the following treatment initiated immediately after the intrathecal injection: Vincristine is a vesicant and may cause a severe local reaction on extravasation. If leakage into the surrounding tissue should occur during intravenous administration of vincristine, the injection should be discontinued immediately and any remaining portion of the dose should be introduced into another vein. Local injection of hyaluronidase with the application of heat has been used to disperse the drug in order to minimise discomfort and the possibility of tissue damage. Leucopenia is less likely following therapy with vincristine than is the case with other oncolytic agents. The risk/benefit should be considered in patients with a history of gout or urate renal stones, as acute uric acid nephropathy, which may occur after the administration of oncolytic agents, has also been reported with vincristine. As vincristine penetrates the blood-brain barrier poorly, additional agents and routes of administration may be required for central nervous system leukaemia. The neurotoxic effect of vincristine may be additive with other neurotoxic agents or increased by spinal cord irradiation and neurological disease. Particular attention should be given to dosage and neurologic side effects if vincristine is administered to patients who have had previous cytotoxic drug therapy or irradiation and in those with pre-existing neuromuscular disease (including sensory peripheral neuropathy and steroid-induced myopathy), and also when other drugs with neurotoxic potential are being used. Acute shortness of breath and severe bronchospasm have been reported following the administration of vinca alkaloids. These reactions have been encountered most frequently when the vinca alkaloid was used in combination with mitomycin and may require aggressive treatment, particularly when there is pre-existing pulmonary dysfunction. Vincristine should not be readministered.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Vinorelbine is a vinca alkaloid that interferes with microtubule assembly. The antitumor activity of vinorelbine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Vinorelbine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca2+ transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. Vinorelbine inhibited mitotic microtubule formation in intact mouse embryo tectal plates at a concentration of 2 \u00b5M inducing a blockade of cells at metaphase, but produced depolymerization of axonal microtubules at a concentration 40 \u00b5M, suggesting a modest selectivity of vinorelbine for mitotic microtubules.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Vinorelbine Tartrate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Available human data are insufficient to inform the drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.There are no data on the presence of vinorelbine in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from vinorelbine, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Vinorelbine Tartrate and for 9 days after the final dose.",

    "Pharmacology": "Vinpocetine increases cerebral metabolism; it increases glucose and O2 consumption; improves cerebral hypoxia tolerance; shifts glucose metabolism to the energetically more favourable aerobic pathway, but it increases the anaerobic pathway as well; it elevates the ATP concentration and the ATP/AMP ratio in the brain, and elevates the cerebral norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin levels.Vinpocetine considerably improves cerebral microcirculation by inhibiting platelet aggregation, reducing the pathologically increased blood viscosity, and increases erythrocyte deformability. It also promotes O2 transport into the tissues by reducing the O2 affinity of erythrocytes.It selectively and intensely increases cerebral blood flow and the share of the brain in cardiac output, it reduces cerebral vascular resistance without affecting systemic circulation (blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance). It does not elicit steal phenomenon; on the contrary, it primarily improves the blood supply of the injured and ischaemic area while it remains unchanged in the intact areas (inverse steal effect). It further increases blood flow which is already increased as a result of hypoxia.",

    "Pharmacology": "Vitamin B-Complex and Vitamin C function as cofactors of various enzymes which regulate carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism.Thiamine (B1) acts as a cofactor in the decarboxylation of keto acids such as pyruvic acid.Riboflavin (B2) plays a vital role in cellular respiratory reactions in conjunction with nicotinamide.Pyridoxine (B6) takes part in decarboxylation and interconversion of amino acids. It is also required for normal antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune responses.Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) is required for synthesis of DNA (deoxyribo-nucleic acid) and maturation of RBCs (red blood cells). Nicotinamide plays a vital role in cellular respiration in conjunction with riboflavin.Calcium Pantothenate functions as a cofactor for enzymes involved in transfer of acetyl groups. It is also required for normal antibody response in conjunction with pyridoxine.Folic acid, after conversion in the body to folinic acid, takes part in reactions involved in the synthesis of nucleotides and maturation of RBCs in conjunction with vitamin B12. It also plays an important role in lymphocyte-mediated immune response.Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) takes part in biochemical reactions involving oxidation, as in collagen synthesis, and in conversion of folic acid to folinic acid. It is also necessary for normal phagocytic function ofWBCs (white blood cells).Thus an adequate supply of these water-soluble vitamins is required for the optimum function of various cells and tissues.Except for Vitamin B12, these water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body to any significant extent, the excess quantities being excreted in the urine. Therefore, a regular and adequate intake of them is necessary to meet the metabolic requirements. Deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins often co-exist because of their overlapping dietary sources and metabolic interdependence. Initially the deficiency of these vitamins may be subclinical and demonstrable only by means of biochemical tests. If not corrected at this stage, it may become manifest as various symptoms, including impaired wound healing and increased susceptibility to infection.\u00a0Classical deficiency diseases such as beri beri, pellagra and scurvy are rare, whereas mild and subclinical deficiencies are probably more common, even among apparently healthy individuals.",

    "name": "Vortioxetine Hydrobromide",
    "generic_id": "2207",
    "Indications": "Vortioxetine is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The mechanism of the antidepressant effect of Vortioxetine is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system through inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). It also has several other activities including 5-HT3 receptor antagonism and 5-HT1A receptor agonism.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended dose: The recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals. The dosage should then be increased to 20 mg/day, as tolerated. The efficacy and safety of doses above 20 mg/day have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. A dose decrease down to 5 mg/day may be considered for patients who do not tolerate higher doses. The lowest effective dose of 5 mg/day should always be used as the starting dose for elderly patients (>65 years of age).Maintenance dose: For MDD, Vortioxetine can be administered for several months or longer. For a long period use patients should be re-evaluated to assess the usefulness of the drugs for individual patients.Discontinuation treatment: Although Vortioxetine can be abruptly discontinued, in placebo-controlled trials patients experienced transient adverse reactions such as headache and muscle tension following abrupt discontinuation of Vortioxetine 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day. To avoid these adverse reactions, it is recommended that the dose should be decreased to 10 mg/day for one week before full discontinuation of Vortioxetine 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day.Switching a patient to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) intended to treat Psychiatric Disorders: At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with Vortioxetine to avoid the risk of Serotonin Syndrome. Conversely, at least 21 days must elapse after stopping Vortioxetine before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders.",
    "Interaction": "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Adverse reactions, some of which are serious or fatal, can develop in patients who use MAOIs or who have recently been discontinued from an MAOI and started on a serotonergic antidepressant(s) or who have recently had SSRI or SNRI therapy discontinued prior to initiation of an MAOI.Serotonergic drugs: Co-administration of Vortioxetine with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems (e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs, Triptans, Buspirone, Tramadol, and Tryptophan products etc.) may potentially increase serotonin toxicity or serotonin syndrome. Closely monitor symptoms of serotonin syndrome if Vortioxetine is co-administered with other serotonergic drugs. Treatment with Vortioxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if serotonin syndrome occurs. Other CNS active agents: No clinically relevant effect was observed on steady-state Lithium exposure following co-administration with multiple daily doses of Vortioxetine.Potential for other drugs to affect Vortioxetine: Reduce Vortioxetine dose by half when a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. Bupropion, Fuoxetine, Paroxetine, Quinidine) is co-administered. Consider increasing the Vortioxetine dose when a strong CYP inducer (e.g. Rifampin, Carbamazepine, Phenytoin) is co-administered.",
    "Contraindications": "Vortioxetine Hydrobromide is contraindicated in Patients with known hypersensitivity to Vortioxetine or any of the excipients of the drug product & concomitant use of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs).",
    "Side Effects": "Patients taking Vortioxetine may experience some adverse events such as Hypersensitivity, Clinical worsening and suicide risk, Serotonin syndrome, Abnormal bleeding, activation of Mania/Hypomania, Angle closure Glaucoma, Hyponatremia.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "The safety of Vortioxetine in human pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, Vortioxetine should not be used during pregnancy or in women intending to become pregnant, unless the benefits outweigh the possible risks to the fetus. Available data in animals have shown the excretion of Vortioxetine metabolites in milk. It is expected that Vortioxetine will be excreted into human milk. Because risks to the nursing child cannot be excluded, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Vortioxetine.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonergic antidepressants including Vortioxetine, when used alone but more often when used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs (including Triptans, Tricyclic Antidepressants, Fentanyl, Lithium, Tramadol, Tryptophan, Buspirone & St. John's Wort), and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as Linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).Abnormal Bleeding: The use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Vortioxetine, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of Aspirin, NonsteroidalAnti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Warfarin, and other Anticoagulants may add to this risk. Activation ofMania/Hypomania: As with all Antidepressants, use Vortioxetine cautiously in patients with a history or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. Angle Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following the use of many Antidepressant drugs, including Vortioxetine, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Hyponatremia: Hyponatremia occurrs because of treatment with serotonergic drugs.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/1166/warfarin-sodium": {
    "name": "Warfarin Sodium",
    "generic_id": "1166",
    "Indications": "Warfarin is indicated in the following conditions-\n\nProphylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation and/or cardiac valve replacement\nIndicated to reduce the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial infarction\nProphylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism\nTransient ischaemic attacks.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase. The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH2 is a cofactor used in the \u03b3-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin. Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca2+ and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require \u03b3-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH2 is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the \u03b3-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by \u03b3-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K1 by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH2 by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K1. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours. Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect. In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized. It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K2, functionally identical to vitamin K1, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K2",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Whenever possible, the baseline prothrombin time should be determined but the initial dose should not be delayed whilst awaiting the result.Use in adults: The usual adult induction dose of warfarin is 10 mg daily for 2 days. The subsequent maintenance dose depends upon the prothrombin time, reported as INR (international normalized ratio). The daily maintenance dose of warfarin is usually 3 to 9 mg (taken at the same time each day). The maintenance dose is omitted if the prothrombin time is excessively prolonged. Once the maintenance dose is established in the therapeutic range, it is rarely necessary to alter. In emergencies, anticoagulant therapy should be initiated with heparin and warfarin together. Where there is less urgency, as in patients disposed to or at special risk of thromboembolism, anticoagulant therapy may be initiated with warfarin alone. Control tests must be made at regular intervals and maintenance dosage further adjusted according to the results obtained.Use in children: Safety and efficacy in children <18 years old have not been established. However, there is evidence of use and the initial dose is usually 0.1 mg.kg-1.d-1 adjusted subsequently to aim for an INR range the same as in adults.",
    "Interaction": "Oral anticoagulants have a greater potential for clinically significant drug interactions. Warn all patients about potential hazards and instruct against taking or withdrawing any drug, including non-prescription products, without the advice of a physician.",
    "Contraindications": "Warfarin can not be administered in the following cases;\n\nActual or potential hemorrhagic conditions, eg. Peptic ulcer, or to patients with uncontrolled hypertension\nSevere hepatic or renal disease\nPregnancy\nKnown hypersensitivity to warfarin\nBacterial endocarditis\n\r\nIts use within 24 hours following surgery or labor should be undertaken with caution, if at all.",
    "Side Effects": "Hemorrhage is the principal adverse effect of oral anticoagulants. Other adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersensitivity, rash, alopecia, and unexplained drop in haematocrit, \"purple toes\", skin necrosis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Warfarin is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy because of the risk of teratogenicity. It should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant because the drug passes through the placental barrier and may cause fatal hemorrhage to the fetus. Warfarin appears in the milk of nursing mothers in an inactive form. Infants nursed by mothers treated with Warfarin had no change in prothrombin times. Effects in premature infants have not been evaluated.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Periodic determination of prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or other suitable coagulation test is essential. Numerous factors, alone or in combination, including travel, changes in diet, environment, physical state and medication may influence response of the patient to anticoagulants. It is generally good practice to monitor the patient's response with additional PT/INR determination in the period immediately after discharge from the hospital, and whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued or taken irregularly. The following factors may exaggerate the effects of warfarin and necessitate a reduction in dosage; loss of weight, elderly subject, acute illness, deficient renal function, decreased dietary intake of vitamin K, administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Factors which may call for an increase in maintenance dosage include weight gain, diarrhea and vomiting, increased intake of vitamin K, fats and oils, and the administration of certain drugs. Careful additional laboratory control is necessary if the patient is to be changed from one formulation to another. Reversal of warfarin anticoagulation by vitamin K takes several days. In emergency situations fresh frozen plasma should be given.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Nasal congestion is caused by various etiologies, such as rhinosinusitis and allergic or non-allergic rhinitis, leading to congestion of the venous sinusoids lining the nasal mucosa. Activation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors leads to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and resumption of nasal airflow. As the most abundantly expressed in the human nasal mucosa, \u03b11A- and \u03b12B-adrenoceptors may play the most important role in vasoconstriction of the human nasal mucosa. Xylometazoline is a more selective agonist at \u03b12B-adrenoceptors, with affinity at \u03b11A-, \u03b12A-, \u03b12C-, \u03b11B-, and \u03b11D-adrenoceptors. Xylometazoline decreases nasal resistance during inspiration and expiration and increases the volume of nasal airflow. Compared to oxymetazoline, another imidazoline nasal decongestant, xylometazoline had a slightly faster onset of action although they had a similar duration of action. In one study, subjects with nasal congestion reported relief of earache and sore throat in addition to nasal decongestion: it is speculated that oxymetazoline mediates this effect by causing vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa that contains the venous sinuses and nasal decongestion allows breathing through the nose, providing relief from sore throat caused by mouth breathing that dries and irritates the throat.",

The first dose should be given at least 10 days before protection from yellow fever is needed. This is because it takes 10 days for the first dose of vaccine to work and provide good protection against the yellow fever virus. The protection provided by this dose is expected to last at least 10 years and maybe life-long. In some circumstances, a booster with one dose (0.5 millilitre) may be needed:\n\nif you or your child had an insufficient response to the first dose and you or your child continue to be at risk for yellow fever virus infection.\nor depending on official recommendations.\n\r\nYellow Fever Vaccine is given as an injection by a qualified and trained healthcare professional. It is usually injected just underneath the skin but it can be given into a muscle. It must not be injected into a blood vessel.",
    "Interaction": "Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. If you have recently had any treatment or medicine which may have weakened your immune system, the vaccination must be delayed until your laboratory results show that your immune system has recovered. Your doctor will advise you when it is safe for you to be vaccinated. Yellow Fever Vaccine can be given at the same time as measles vaccine or vaccines against typhoid fever (those containing the Vi capsular polysaccharide) and/or hepatitis A. Vaccination with Yellow Fever Vaccine may lead to false positive results of blood tests for dengue or Japanese encephalitis. If you or your child have in the future such tests prescribed, please inform your doctor about this vaccination.",
    "Contraindications": "Do not use Yellow Fever Vaccine if you or your child are allergic to:\n\nthe active substance, or\nany of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in Section 6), or\neggs or chicken proteins.\nhave experienced a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any yellow fever vaccine,\nis less than 6 months old,\nhave a poor or weakened immune system for any reason, such as illness or medical treatments (for example high-dose steroids, or any other medicines that affect the immune system, or chemotherapy). If you are unsure whether the medication may affect your or your child\u2019s immune system, discuss with your healthcare professional before the vaccine is administered.\nhave a weakened immune system due to HIV infection. Your healthcare professional will advise you if you or your child can still receive Yellow Fever Vaccine based on the results of your blood tests,\nare infected with HIV and have active symptoms due to the infection,\nhave a history of problems with your or your child\u2019s thymus gland or have had the thymus gland removed for any reason,\nhave an illness with a high or moderate fever or an acute illness.

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/1142/zaleplon": {
    "name": "Zaleplon",
    "generic_id": "1142",
    "Indications": "Zaleplon is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Zaleplon has been shown to decrease the time to sleep onset for up to 30 days in controlled clinical trials.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Zaleplon is a newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class. So, its chemical structure is unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties. It interacts with the gamma aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABA-BZ) receptor complex.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The dose of Zaleplon should be individualized. The recommended dose of Zaleplon for most non elderly adults is 10 mg. For certain low weight individuals, 5 mg may be a sufficient dose. Although the risk of certain adverse events associated with the use of Zaleplon appears to be dose dependent, the 20 mg dose has been shown to be adequately tolerated and may be considered for occasional patient who does not benefit from a trial of lower dose. Dosage above 20 mg has not been adequately evaluated and is not recommended.Zaleplon should be taken immediately before bedtime. Taking Zaleplon with or immediately after a heavy, high fat meal results in slower absorption and would be expected to reduce the effect of Zaleplon on sleep latency. Elderly patients and debilitated patients appear to be more sensitive to the effects of hypnotic, and respond to 5 mg of Zaleplon. The recommended dose for these patients is therefore 5 mg, doses over 10 mg are not recommended. For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, no dose adjustment is necessary.An initial dose of 5 mg should be given to patients concomitantly taking Cimetidine because Zaleplon clearance is reduced in this population.Pediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of Zaleplon in pediatric patients have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "Zaleplon has been shown to have minimal effects on the kinetic of Warfarin, Imipramine, Ethanol, Ibuprofen, Diphenhydramine, Thioridazine, and Digoxin.",
    "Contraindications": "Zaleplon is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
    "Side Effects": "Side effects of Zaleplon appear to be dose related. So, it is important to use the lowest possible effective dose, specially in the elderly. The side effects are usually mild and transient, the most common are diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, headache, asthenia, nightmare etc.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: There are no studies of Zaleplon in pregnant women; therefore, it is not recommended for use in women during pregnancy. Zaleplon has no established use in labour and delivery.Lactation: A study in lactating mothers indicated that the clearance and half-life of Zaleplon is similar to that in young normal subjects. A small amount of Zaleplon is excreted in breast milk, with the highest excreted amount occurring during a feeding at approximately 1 hour after Zaleplon administration. Since the small amount of the drug from breast milk may result in potentially important concentrations in infants, and because the effects of Zaleplon on a nursing infant are not known, it is not recommended in nursing mothers.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Timing of drug administration: Zaleplon should be taken immediately before bedtime or after the patient has gone to bed.Use in the elderly and/or debilitated patients: Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and/or debilitated patients. A dose of 5 mg is recommended for elderly patients to decrease the possibility of side effects. Elderly and/or debilitated patients should be monitored closely.Use in patients with concomitant illness: Zaleplon should be used with caution in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or haemodynamic responses. Although preliminary studies did not reveal respiratory depressant effects at hypnotic doses of Zaleplon in normal subjects, caution should be observed if Zaleplon is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function, because sedative/hypnotic have the capacity to depress respiratory drive. However, patients with compromised respiration due to preexisting illness should be monitored carefully. The dose of Zaleplon should be reduced to 5 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. It is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Renal impairment patients: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Zaleplon has not been adequately studied in patients with severe renal impairment.Use in patients with depression: As with other sedative or hypnotic drugs, Zaleplon should be administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of depression",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic acid is rapidly distributed to bone. The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcemia demonstrated that the effect of Zoledronic acid is characterized by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In addition to its inhibitory activity against bone resorption, Zoledronic acid also possesses anti-tumour activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-pain activity, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour cells and synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "In clinical studies, Zoledronic acid has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without interactions. Caution is advised when Zoledronic acid are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Zoledronic acid is used in combination with thalidomide. Concomitant use of loop diuretics with Zoledronic acid increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Caution is indicated when Zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.",
    "Contraindications": "The drug is contraindicated if patients have hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates; severe renal impairment (Creatinine clearance <30 ml/min); pregnancy and lactation.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Zoledronic Acid is a bisphosphonate and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic Acid rapidly partitions to bone and localizes preferentially at sites of high bone turnover. The main molecular target of Zoledronic Acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. The relatively long duration of action of Zoledronic Acid is attributable to its high binding affinity to bone mineral.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of Zolmitriptan\u00a0for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which results in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Tablet: The recommended starting dose of Zolmitriptan is 2.5 mg tablet. Maximum recommended single dose is 5 mg. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking Zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hours period.Nasal Spray: Administer one dose of Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray 5 mg for the treatment of acute migraine. If the headache returns the dose may be repeated after 2 hours. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period. In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 5 mg zolmitriptan nasal spray were administered into one nostril and were effective for the treatment of acute migraines in adults. Individuals may vary in response to Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray. The pharmacokinetics of a 5 mg nasal spray dose is similar to the 5 mg oral formulations. Doses lower than 5 mg can only be achieved through the use of an oral formulation. The choice of dose, and route of administration should therefore be made on an individual basis. The effectiveness of a second dose has not been established in placebo-controlled trials. The safety of treating an average of more than four headaches in a 30 day period has not been established.",

    "name": "Zonisamide",
    "generic_id": "1380",
    "Indications": "Zonisamide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in adults with\u00a0epilepsy.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The precise mechanism(s) by which zonisamide exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown. Zonisamide demonstrated\u00a0anticonvulsant\u00a0activity in several experimental models. In animals, zonisamide was effective against tonic\u00a0extension\u00a0seizures induced by maximal electroshock but ineffective against clonic seizures induced by subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol. Zonisamide raised the threshold for generalized seizures in the kindled rat model and reduced the duration of\u00a0cortical\u00a0focal\u00a0seizures induced by electrical stimulation of the visual\u00a0cortex\u00a0in cats. Furthermore, zonisamide suppressed both interictal spikes and the secondarily generalized seizures produced by cortical application of tungstic acid gel in rats or by cortical freezing in cats. The relevance of these models to human\u00a0epilepsy\u00a0is unknown.Zonisamide may produce these effects through action at sodium and calcium channels. In vitro pharmacological studies suggest that zonisamide blocks sodium channels and reduces voltagedependent, transient inward currents (T-type Ca2+\u00a0currents), consequently stabilizing neuronal membranes and suppressing neuronal hypersynchronization. In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that zonisamide binds to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex in an allosteric fashion which does not produce changes in chloride flux. Other in vitro studies have demonstrated that zonisamide (10\u201330 \u03bcg/mL) suppresses synaptically-driven electrical activity without affecting postsynaptic GABA or\u00a0glutamate\u00a0responses (cultured mouse\u00a0spinal cord\u00a0neurons) or neuronal or glial uptake of [3H]-GABA (rat hippocampal slices). Thus, zonisamide does not appear to potentiate the synaptic activity of GABA. In vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that zonisamide facilitates both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission.Zonisamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The contribution of this pharmacological action to the therapeutic effects of zonisamide is unknown. However, as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, zonisamide may cause metabolic\u00a0acidosis",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Zonisamide\u00a0is recommended as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established. Zonisamide should be administered once or twice daily, using 25 mg or 100 mg capsules. Zonisamide is given orally and can be taken with or without food. Capsules should be swallowed whole.Adults Over Age 16: The prescriber should be aware that, because of the long half-life of zonisamide, up to two weeks may be required to achieve steady state levels upon reaching a stable dose or following dosage adjustment. Although the regimen described below is one that has been shown to be tolerated, the prescriber may wish to prolong the duration of treatment at the lower doses in order to fully assess the effects of zonisamide at steady state, noting that many of the side effects of zonisamide are more frequent at doses of 300 mg per day and above. Although there is some evidence of greater response at doses above 100-200 mg/day, the increase appears small and formal dose-response studies have not been conducted.The initial dose of Zonisamide should be 100 mg daily. After two weeks, the dose may be increased to 200 mg/day for at least two weeks. It can be increased to 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day, with the dose stable for at least two weeks to achieve steady state at each level. Evidence from controlled trials suggests that Zonisamide doses of 100-600 mg/day are effective, but there is no suggestion of increasing response above 400 mg/day. There is little experience with doses greater than 600 mg/day.",
    "Interaction": "Not available",
    "Contraindications": "Zonisamide is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to\u00a0sulfonamides\u00a0or zonisamide.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common adverse reactions with Zonisamide (an incidence at least 4% greater than placebo) in controlled clinical trials and shown in descending order of frequency were\u00a0somnolence,\u00a0anorexia, dizziness,\u00a0ataxia, agitation/irritability, and difficulty with memory and/or concentration.In controlled clinical trials, 12% of patients receiving Zonisamide as adjunctive therapy discontinued due to an adverse reaction compared to 6% receiving placebo. Approximately 21% of the 1,336 patients with\u00a0epilepsy\u00a0who received Zonisamide in clinical studies discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were somnolence, fatigue and/or ataxia (6%), anorexia (3%), difficulty concentrating (2%), difficulty with memory, mental slowing, nausea/vomiting (2%), and weight loss (1%). Many of these adverse reactions were doserelated",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Zonisamide may cause serious adverse fetal effects, based on clinical and nonclinical data. Zonisamide was teratogenic in multiple animal species.Zonisamide treatment causes metabolic acidosis in humans. The effect of zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis has not been studied in pregnancy; however, metabolic acidosis in pregnancy (due to other causes) may be associated with decreased fetal growth, decreased fetal\u00a0oxygenation, and fetal death, and may affect the fetus's ability to tolerate labor. Pregnant patients should be monitored for metabolic acidosis and treated as in the non-pregnant state.\u00a0Newborns of mothers treated with zonisamide should be monitored for metabolic acidosis because of transfer of zonisamide to the fetus and possible occurrence of transient metabolic acidosis following birth. Transient metabolic acidosis has been reported in neonates born to mothers treated during pregnancy with a different carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Somnolence is commonly reported, especially at higher doses of Zonisamide. Zonisamide is metabolized by the liver and eliminated by the kidneys; caution should therefore be exercised when administering Zonisamide to patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction",
