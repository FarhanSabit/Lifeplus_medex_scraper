    "name": "Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Poliomyelitis Vaccine",
    "generic_id": "1974",
    "Indications": "This vaccine is indicated for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis:\n\nfor primary vaccination in infants from the age of 2 months, for booster vaccination, one year after primary vaccination during the second year of life,\nfor booster vaccination between 5 and 13 years of age, according to official recommendations.",
    "Composition": "One dose (0.5 mL) contains:\n\nDiphtheria toxoid \u226530 IU\nTetanus toxoid \u226540 IU\n\r\nBordetella pertussis antigens:\n\nPertussis toxoid: 25 micrograms\nFilamentous haemagglutinin: 25 micrograms\n\r\nPoliomyelitis virus (inactivated)\n\ntype 1 (Mahoney strain): 40 DU\ntype 2 (MEF-1 strain): 8 DU\ntype 3 (Saukett strain): 32 DU",
    "Pharmacology": "Not available",
    "Dosage & Administration": "This vaccine must be administered according to the official recommendations in effect. Primary vaccination: 3 injections given at an interval of one month, i.e. according to the official schedule, at the age of 2, 3, 4 months.Booster vaccination: 1 injection one year after primary vaccination, i.e. usually, between 16 and 18 months. Booster vaccination between 5 and 13 years of age: 1 injection. For primary vaccination and for the first booster dose, this vaccine may be administered by reconstituting the Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Act-HIB) or administered at the same time as this vaccine, but at two separate injection sites.Administer via the intramuscular route. Administration should preferably be performed in the antero-lateral side of the thigh (middle third) in infants and in the deltoid area in children",
    "Interaction": "This vaccine can be administered simultaneously with the M-M-RVAXPRO vaccine or with the HBVAXPRO vaccine, but in two separate sites This vaccine can be associated or combined with the Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Act-HIB).",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity:\n\nto any of the active substances of this vaccine,\nto any of the excipients listed in section 6.1,\nto glutaraldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, or polymyxin B (used during the manufacturing process and which may be present as traces)\nto a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell).\n\r\nLife-threatening reaction after previous administration of the same vaccine or a vaccine containing the same substances. Vaccination must be postponed in case of febrile or acute disease. Evolving encephalopathy. Encephalopathy within 7 days of administration of a previous dose of any vaccine containing pertussis antigens (whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines).",
    "Side Effects": "The safety profile is described below according to the clinical data generated in France, South Korea, Chile and Thailand. In clinical studies in children who received TETRAXIM as a primary series, stand alone or combined with the Act- HIB vaccine, the most frequently reported reactions are local injection-site reactions, abnormal crying, loss of appetite and irritability. These signs and symptoms usually occur within 48 hours following the vaccination and may continue for 48-72 hours. They resolve spontaneously without requiring specific treatment. The frequency of injection-site reactions tends to increase at booster vaccination compared with the frequency observed for primary series. The safety profile of TETRAXIM does not differ significantly according to age groups. However certain reactions (myalgia, malaise, headache) are specific to children aged 2 years or more.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Not available",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The immunogenicity of this vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or immunodeficiency. It is then recommended to wait until the end of the treatment or disease before vaccinating. Nevertheless, vaccination of subjects with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV infection is recommended even if the immune response may be limited. If Guillain-Barre syndrome or brachial neuritis has occurred in subjects following receipt of prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. Vaccination is usually justified for infants whose primary immunization schedules are incomplete (i.e. fewer than three doses administered). Do not inject via the intravascular route: make sure the needle does not penetrate a blood vessel. Do not inject via the intradermal route. As with all injectable vaccines, This vaccine must be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/371/dipyridamole": {
    "name": "Dipyridamole",
    "generic_id": "371",
    "Indications": "Dipyridamole capsule is indicated in-\n\nSecondary prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attacks either alone or in conjunction with aspirin.\nAn adjunct to oral anti-coagulation for prophylaxis of thromboembolism associated with prosthetic heart valves.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Dipyridamole likely inhibits both adenosine deaminase and phosphodiesterase, preventing the degradation of cAMP, an inhibitor of platelet function. This elevation in cAMP blocks the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and reduces thromboxane A2 activity. Dipyridamole also directly stimulates the release of prostacyclin, which induces adenylate cyclase activity, thereby raising the intraplatelet concentration of cAMP and further inhibiting platelet aggregation.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults including the elderly: The recommended dose is 200 mg capsule twice daily, usually one in the morning and one in the evening preferably with meals. The capsules should be swallowed whole without chewing.Children: Dipyridamole 200 mg capsule is not recommended for children.",
    "Interaction": "Dipyridamole increases the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage should therefore be considered if use with dipyridamole is unavoidable. There is evidence that the effects of acetylsalicylic acid and dipyridamole on platelet behaviour are additive. When dipyridamole is used in combination with anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid, the statements on intolerance and risks for these preparations must be observed. Addition of dipyridamole to acetylsalicylic acid does not increase the incidence of bleeding events. When dipyridamole was administered concomitantly with warfarin, bleeding was no greater in frequency or severity than that observed when warfarin was administered alone. Dipyridamole may increase the hypotensive effect of blood pressure lowering drugs and may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to any component of the product. Warnings and precautions: Among other properties, dipyridamole acts as a potent vasodilator. It should therefore be used with caution in patients with severe coronary artery disease including unstable angina and/or recent myocardial infarction, left ventricular outflow obstruction or haemodynamic instability (e.g. decompensated heart failure). Patients being treated with regular oral doses of Dipyridamole MR should not receive additional intravenous dipyridamole. Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with oral dipyridamole who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole, should discontinue drugs containing oral dipyridamole for twenty-four hours prior to stress testing. In patients with myasthenia gravis readjustment of therapy may be necessary after changes in dipyridamole dosage. Dipyridamole should be used with caution in patients with coagulation disorders.",
    "Side Effects": "The following side effects have been reported, Blood and lymphatic system disorders- Thrombocytopenia; Immune system disorders- Hypersensitivity, Angioedema; Nervous system disorders- Headache, Dizziness; Cardiac disorders- Angina pectoris, Tachycardia; Vascular disorders- Hypotension, Hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders- Bronchospasm; Gastrointestinal disorders- Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- Rash, Urticaria; Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders- Myalgia, Injury, poisoning and procedural complications- post procedural haemorrhage, operative haemorrhage.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There is inadequate evidence of safety in human pregnancy, but dipyridamole has been used for many years without apparent ill-consequence. Animal studies have shown no hazard. Nevertheless, medicines should not be used in pregnancy, especially the first trimester unless the expected benefit is thought to outweigh the possible risk to the foetus. Dipyridamole MR should only be used during lactation if considered essential by the physician.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "In patients with rapidly worsening angina, subvalvular aortic stenosis, haemodynamic instability associated with recent MI or coagulation disorders esp when given IV during myocardial imaging. Hypotension, unstable angina, aortic stenosis. Pregnancy and lactation. Safety and efficacy are not established in childn < 12 yrs.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Anti-platelet drugs",
    "Storage Conditions": "Keep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children."

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/375/dobutamine-hydrochloride": {
    "name": "Dobutamine Hydrochloride",
    "generic_id": "375",
    "Indications": "Dobutamine Hydrochloride is indicated when inotropic support is necessary for the treatment of patients with hypoperfusion states in whom cardiac output is insufficient to meet circulatory demands. Dobutamine Hydrochloride is also indicated when inotropic support is required for the treatment of patients in whom abnormally increased ventricular filling pressures introduce the risk of pulmonary congestion and oedema.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Dobutamine Hydrochloride is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of cardiac adrenergic receptors; it produces comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic and vasodilatory effects. In contrast with dopamine, it does not release norepinephrine and its actions are not dependent on norepinephrine stores in the heart. In humans, Dobutamine Hydrochloride increases stroke volume and cardiac output and decreases ventricular filling pressure and total systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Because of its short half-life, Dobutamine Hydrochloride must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Following the initiation of a constant rate infusion, or upon changing the rate, a steady-state dobutamine plasma concentration is achieved within approximately 10 minutes. Thus, loading doses or bolus injections are not necessary and are not recommended.Recommended Dosage: The rate of infusion needed to increase cardiac output has ranged from 2.5 to 10 mcg/kg/min in the majority of patients. Frequently, doses up to 20 mcg/kg/min are required for adequate haemodynamic improvement. On rare occasions, infusion rates up to 40 mcg/kg/min have been reported. The rate of administration and the duration of therapy should be adjusted according to the patient's response, The indicators are: haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and rhythm, arterial pressure, and, whenever possible, cardiac output and measurements of ventricular filling pressures and signs of pulmonary congestion. Concentrations up to 5,000 mg/L have been administered to humans. The final volume administered should be determined by the fluid requirements of the patient. Rather than abruptly discontinuing therapy with Dobutamine Hydrochloride, it is often advisable to decrease the dosage gradually.Rates of Infusion Based on Concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride: The rates of fluid infusion that are required to deliver specific dosages are a function of the concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride in the infusate. The following table provides a guideline of infusion rates (mL/kg/min) required for 3 frequently used concentrations of Dobutamine Hydrochloride (250, 500, and 1000 mg/L).Dobutamine Injection when diluted to 250 micrograms/mL and 500 micrograms/mL with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection and 5% Glucose Injection, was found to be stable for 24 hours at room temperature and in the presence of fluorescent light.",
    "Interaction": "The potency of Dobutamine Hydrochloride may be decreased if the patient is given b-adrenergic receptor antagonists. In such a case, the unopposed a-agonist effects of Dobutamine Hydrochloride may become apparent, including peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension. Conversely, a-adrenergic blockade may make the b-1 and b-2 effects apparent, resulting in tachycardia and vasodilatation.There has been no overt indication of medicine interactions in clinical studies in which Dobutamine Hydrochloride was administered concurrently with other medicines, including digitalis preparations, furosemide, spironolactone, lidocaine, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, isosorbide dinitrate, morphine, atropine, heparin, protamine, potassium chloride, folic acid, and paracetamol.",
    "Contraindications": "Dobutamine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown previous manifestations of hypersensitivity to Dobutamine Hydrochloride.",
    "Side Effects": "Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Ventricular Ectopic Activity\nHypotension\nReactions at Sites of Intravenous Infusion\nMiscellaneous",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Since there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, Dobutamine Hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the foetus. It is not known whether this medicine is excreted in human milk. Because many medicines are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Dobutamine Hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. If a mother requires dobutamine treatment, breastfeeding should be discontinued for the duration of the treatment.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "During the administration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride, as with any parenteral catecholamine, heart rate and rhythm, arterial blood pressure, and infusion rate should be monitored closely.

    "Pharmacology": "Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent, which acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin thereby decreasing the critical intracellular concentration of tubulin. The promoted polymerization of microtubules leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, resulting in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. The binding of Docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules; in that, it differs from other spindle poisons. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumor cell lines, and against freshly excised human tumor cells in clonogenic assays. In addition, Docetaxel was found to be active on a number of cell lines overexpressing the p-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the multidrug resistant gene.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Ear wax which often obstructs the external auditory meatus of the ear contains less than 50% of fatty matter derived from secretions of the sebaceous ceruminous glands. The majority of the wax consists of desquamated epithelium, foreign matter and shed hairs. This non-fatty material forms a matrix holding together the granules of fatty matter to form the ceruminous mass. The addition of oils or solvents binds the mass more firmly together, but aqueous solutions, if they are able to penetrate the matrix, cause a disintegration of the ceruminous mass. Docusate Sodium ear drops, because of their low surface tension and miscibility, rapidly penetrate the dry matrix of the ceruminous mass, reducing the solid ear wax to a semi-solid debris.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Domperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\n\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\nChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\n\r\nIn dyspeptic symptom:\n\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\n\r\nIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\n\nAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\n\r\nBy rectum in suppositories:\n\nAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\nChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\nThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.",
    "Interaction": "Concomitant administration of anticholinergic\u00a0drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs\u00a0should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The\u00a0main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the\u00a0concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma\u00a0levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide\u00a0antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has\u00a0gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered\u00a0drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in\u00a0patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of\u00a0domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\n\nneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\ndopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.",
    "Contraindications": "Domperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).",
    "Side Effects": "Side-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been\u00a0reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they\u00a0reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland\u00a0is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma\u00a0prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological\u00a0phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature\u00a0(as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally\u00a0excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Domperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did\u00a0not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used\u00a0during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit.\u00a0Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans.\u00a0The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in\u00a0breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether\u00a0this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are\u00a0taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk.\u00a0Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Domperidone should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Dopamine is a preparation of Dopamine hydrochloride which can stimulate \u03b1, \u03b2 and dopamine receptors. It is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. It produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on \u03b2-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and so does not activate dopamine receptors in the brain.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "The action of dopamine hydrochloride is potentiated by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI's). The concurrent administration of cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics may cause ventricular arrhythmias. The cardiac effects of dopamine hydrochloride are antagonized by \u03b2 - adrenergic blocking agents such as Propranolol and Metoprolol. The ergot alkaloids should be avoided because of the possibility of excessive vasoconstriction. Tricyclic antidepressants and guanethidine may potentiate the pressor response to dopamine hydrochloride. Hypotension and bradycardia have been observed in patients receiving Phenytoin. Dopamine hydrochloride may increase the effect of diuretic agents. Peripheral vasoconstriction may be antagonized by \u03b1 - adrenergic blocking agents, such as Phentolamine. Other vasodilators may also be useful in patients with heart failure, allowing greater inotropic and renal effects without the associated vasoconstriction. Care must be taken to avoid hypotension.",
    "Contraindications": "Dopamine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to dopamine or any of its ingredients. It should not be used in patients with phaeochromocytoma, uncorrected tachyarrhythmias, or ventricular fibrillation. Dextrose solution without electrolytes should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because of the possibility of pseudoagglutination of red cells.",
    "Side Effects": "The most frequent reported adverse reactions are ectopic beats, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, anginal pain, palpitations, dyspnoea, headache, hypotension, hypertension and vasoconstriction. Other less frequent adverse reactions are aberrant ventricular conduction, bradycardia, piloerection, mydriasis, widened QRS complex, azotaemia and elevated blood pressure. Peripheral ischemic gangrene in patients with pre-existing vascular disease. Fatal ventricular arrhythmias have been reported on rare occasions.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Animal studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenic effects from dopamine hydrochloride. The drug may be used in pregnant women when in the judgment of the physician the expected benefits outweigh the potential for risk to the fetus. It is not known if dopamine hydrochloride is excreted in breast milk, nor is the effect on the infant known. It is not recommended for breast-feeding mothers unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risks",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Dopamine hydrochloride should not be administered in the presence of uncorrected tachyarrhythmia or ventricular fibrillation. It is metabolized in the tissues and blood by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Dopamine hydrochloride and its metabolites are almost completely excreted in the urine. Patients who have been treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) prior to the administration of dopamine will require substantially reduced dosages of later. The starting dose in such patients should be reduced to at least one-tenth (1/10) of the usual dose. Excess administration of potassium-free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia. The intravenous administration of these solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentration, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary oedema. Closely monitoring is advised in patients with impaired renal and hepatic function.Hypovolaemia should be corrected where necessary prior to treatment with dopamine hydrochloride. If a disproportionate rise in diastolic blood pressure (i.e. a marked decrease in pulse pressure) is observed, the infusion rate should be decreased and the patients observed carefully for further evidence of predominant vasoconstriction activity, unless such effect is desired. Dopamine hydrochloride infusion should be withdrawn gradually, to avoid unnecessary hypotension. Patients with a history of peripheral vascular disease (e.g. atherosclerosis, arterial embolism, Raynaud's disease, cold injury, diabetic endarteritis and Buerger's disease) should be closely monitored for any changes in color or temperature of the skin in the extremities. If ischemia occurs and is thought to be the result of vasoconstriction, the benefits of continued dopamine hydrochloride infusion should be weighed against the risk of possible necrosis. These changes may be reversed by either decreasing the rate or discontinuing the infusion. Dopamine hydrochloride in 5% dextrose solution should be infused into a large vein whenever possible to prevent the possibility of infiltration of perivascular tissue adjacent to the infusion site. Extravasations may cause necrosis and sloughing of the surrounding tissue. Ischaemia can be reversed by infiltration of the affected area with 10-15ml of saline containing 5 to 10mg Phentolamine mesylate. Dopamine hydrochloride should be used with extreme caution in patients inhaling cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon anaesthetics due to the arterial arrhythmogenic potential. Dextrose solutions should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or over diabetes mellitus.",

There is no accumulation of Doripenem following multiple intravenous infusions of either 500 mg or 1 g administered every 8 hours for 7 to 10 days in subjects with normal renal function.Distribution: The average binding of Doripenem to plasma proteins is approximately 8.1% and is independent of plasma drug concentrations. The median (range) volume of distribution at steady state in healthy subjects is 16.8 L (8.09-55.5 L), similar to extracellular fluid volume (18.2 L).Metabolism: Metabolism of doripenem to a microbiologically inactive ring-opened metabolite (doripenem-M1) occurs primarily via dehydropeptidase-l. In pooled human liver microsomes, no in vitro metabolism of Doripenem could be detected, indicating that Doripenem is not a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes.Excretion: Doripenem is primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys. The mean plasma terminal elimination half-life of Doripenem in healthy non-elderly adults is approximately 1 hour and mean (SD) plasma clearance is 15.9 (5.3) L/hour. Mean renal clearance is 10.8 (3.5) L/hour. In healthy adults given a single 500 mg dose a mean of 70% and 15% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged drug and the ring-opened metabolite, respectively, within 48 hours.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Dotinurad is a URAT1-selective urate reabsorption inhibitor that selectively inhibits URAT1 and inhibits urate reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary urate excretion and lowering serum urate levels. In addition, since it has weak inhibitory effects on ABCG2, OAT1 and OAT3 other than URAT143,44, it is expected to effectively lower serum uric acid levels without affecting uric acid secretion via these transporters. Thus, Dotinurad is a selective urate reabsorption inhibitor (SURI) that inhibits the reabsorption pathway mediated by URAT1 without inhibiting the uric acid secretion pathway mediated by ABCG2, OAT1 and OAT3 because of its high URAT1 selectivity.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The usual adult dosage is 0.5 mg of Dotinurad, administered orally once daily. After that, gradually increase the dose as necessary while checking the blood uric acid level. The maintenance dose is usually 2 mg once a day and the dose may be adjusted according to the patient's condition but the maximum dose should be 4 mg once a day.Precautions Related to Dosage and Administration: In the early stages of treatment with urate-lowering drugs, gouty arthritis (gout attack) may be induced by a rapid decrease in blood uric acid levels. The dose should be gradually increased to 1 mg once a day after 2 weeks and 2 mg once a day after 6 weeks. Patients should be carefully monitored after the dose is increased.Missing dose: If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible when you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Never take two doses at once. Do not stop taking this medicine without your doctor's advice.Overdose: If you accidentally take too much, consult your doctor or pharmacist.",
    "Interaction": "Pyrazinamide: The effect of this drug may be weakened. Pyrazinamide is known to suppress uric acid secretion in renal tubules and may antagonize the promotion of uric acid excretion by this drug.Salicylic acid preparations Aspirin: Salicylic acid preparations are known to suppress uric acid excretion and may antagonize the promotion of uric acid excretion by this drug.",
    "Contraindications": "Dotinurad is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug component.",

    "Indications": "Doxepin is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance. The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy were up to 3 months in duration.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Doxepin binds with high affinity to the histamine H1 receptor (Ki<1 nM) where it functions as an antagonist. The exact mechanism by which doxepin exerts its sleep maintenance effect is unknown but is believed due to its antagonism of the H1 receptor.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Dosing in Adults: The recommended dose of Doxepin for adults is 6 mg once daily. A 3 mg once daily dose may be appropriate for some patients, if clinically indicated.Dosing in the Elderly: The recommended starting dose of Doxepin in elderly patients (\u226565 years old) is 3 mg once daily. The daily dose can be increased to 6 mg, if clinically indicated.Administration: Doxepin should be taken within 30 minutes of bedtime. To minimize the potential for next day effects, Doxepin should not be taken within 3 hours of a meal. The total Doxepin dose should not exceed 6 mg per day.Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Doxepin in pediatric patients have not been evaluated.",
    "Interaction": "Cytochrome P450 Isozymes: Doxepin is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent, by CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Inhibitors of these isozymes may increase the exposure of doxepin. Doxepin is not an inhibitor of any CYP isozymes at therapeutically relevant concentrations. The ability of Doxepin to induce CYP isozymes is not known.Cimetidine: Doxepin exposure is doubled with concomitant administration of cimetidine, a nonspecific inhibitor of CYP isozymes. A maximum dose of 3 mg is recommended in adults and elderly when cimetidine is co administered with Doxepin.Alcohol: When taken with Doxepin, the sedative effects of alcohol may be potentiated.CNS Depressants and Sedating Antihistamines: When taken with Doxepin, the sedative effects of sedating antihistamines and CNS depressants may be potentiated.Tolazamide: A case of severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II diabetic patient maintained on tolazamide (1 g/day) 11 days after the addition of oral doxepin (75 mg/day).",

There has been a report of apnea and drowsiness occurring in a nursing infant whose mother was taking the higher dose of doxepin used to treat depression. Caution should be exercised when Doxepin is administered to nursing women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses: Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Exacerbation of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with hypnotic drugs.Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes: Complex behaviors such as \u201csleep-driving\u201d (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with hypnotics. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as \"sleep-driving\" may occur with hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of Doxepin should be strongly considered for patients who report a \"sleep-driving\" episode. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a hypnotic. As with \"sleep-driving\", patients usually do not remember these events. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably.Suicide Risk and Worsening of Depression: In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics. Doxepin, the active ingredient in Doxepin, is an antidepressant at doses 10- to 100-fold higher than in Doxepin. Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Risk from the lower dose of doxepin in Doxepin can not be excluded. It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.",

It requires metabolic activation to form the active 1\u03b1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (1\u03b1,25-(OH)2D2) metabolite, which binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to result in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and Doxercalciferol have been shown to reduce PTH levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Route of administration: Doxercalciferol injection should be administered intravenously. Ensure serum calcium is not above the upper limit of normal before initiating treatment with Doxercalciferol injection.Administration instructions:\n\nAdminister Doxercalciferol injection intravenously as a bolus dose at the end of dialysis.\nInspect Doxercalciferol injection visually prior to administration; the solution should appear clear and colorless. Do not use if the solution is not clear or particles are present.\n\nDosage recommendations:\n\nInitiate Doxercalciferol injection at a dose of 4 meg given by bolus intravenous administration three times weekly at the end of dialysis (no more frequently than every other day).\nTarget the maintenance dose of Doxercalciferol to intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels within the desired therapeutic range and serum calcium within normal limits.\nMonitor serum calcium, phosphorus and intact PTH levels weekly after initiation of therapy or dose adjustment.\nTitrate the dose of Doxercalciferol injection based on intact PTH. The dose may be increased at 8-week intervals by 1 meg to 2 meg if intact PTH is not lowered by 50% and fails to reach the target range. The maximum dose is 18 meg weekly. Prior to raising the dose, ensure serum calcium is within normal limits. Suspend or decrease the dose if intact PTH is persistently and abnormally low to reduce the risk of adynamic bone disease or if serum calcium is consistently above the normal range to reduce the risk of hypercalcemia. If suspended, the drug should be restarted one week later at a dose that is at least 1 meg lower.\n\nUse in children and adolescents: The safety and effectiveness of doxercalciferol in pediatric patients have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "Drug interaction with medication: Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or other vitamin D compounds may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Thiazide diuretics are known to induce hypercalcemia by reducing excretion of calcium in the urine. Monitor serum calcium concentrations more frequently and adjust doxercalciferol dose as needed. Doxercalciferol can cause hypercalcemia which can potentiate the risk of digitalis toxicity. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms and increase frequency of serum calcium monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of doxercalciferol in patients receiving digitalis compounds. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors may inhibit the 25-hydroxylation of doxercalciferol and thus reduce the formation of active doxercalciferol moiety. If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, dose adjustment of doxercalciferol may be necessary. Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely. Enzyme inducers (e.g., glutethimide and phenobarbital) may affect the 25-hydroxylation of doxercalciferol. If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with an enzyme inducer, dose adjustment of doxercalciferol may be necessary. Concomitant administration of doxercalciferol and high doses of magnesium-containing products may increase the risk of hypermagnesemia. Avoid use of magnesium-containing products and doxercalciferol in patients on chronic renal dialysis.",

    "Pharmacology": "Doxycycline Hydrochloride is a semisynthetic tetracycline antibiotic with broad spectrum activity. It is primarily a bacteriostatic antibiotic. It has a similar spectrum of activity to other tetracyclines but in particular is more active against Staphylococcus aureus and Nocardia. The drug is often active against penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and against strains of those organisms that are resistant to other Tetracyclines. Certain Gram-negative strains of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella, which are often resistant to Tetracycline, may be sensitive to Doxycycline. In addition, 70-90% of the various anaerobes are sensitive to Doxycycline and Bacteroides fragilis is more likely to be sensitive to Doxycycline than to other tetracyclines.Doxycycline is active against most strains of Haemophilus influenzaeand is particularly useful for infections with H. ducreyi, Actinomyces, Brucella and Vibrio cholerae. It is also active against Nocardia, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and a wide range of Rickettsiae.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Drospirenone is a progestin and is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy. It is an oral contraceptive that lowers the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue with anti-mineralocorticoid activity.Absorption: The pharmacokinetics of oral Drospirenone is dose-proportional following single doses ranging from 1-10 mg. Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of Drospirenone in plasma of about 27 ng/ml are reached at about 2-6 hours after single ingestion of During a treatment cycle, maximum steady-state concentrations of Drospirenone in serum of about 41 ng/ml are reached after about 10 days of treatment. Concomitant ingestion of food has no influence on the extent of absorption of Drospirenone.Distribution: Drospirenone is 95% to 97% bound to serum albumin & does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). The apparent volume of distribution of Drospirenone is approximately 4 L/kg.Metabolism: Drospirenone is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The two main metabolites of found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydro Drospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4.Excretion: Drospirenone serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of Drospirenone was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. Drospirenone was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged Drospirenone were excreted in urine and feces.",

Take one tablet daily for 28 consecutive days; one white active tablet daily during the first 24 days and one light pink inert tablet daily during the 4 following days. Tablets must be taken every day at about the same time of the day so that the interval between two tablets is always 24 hours.Instructions for starting of Drospirenone: Starting in females with no current use of hormonal contraception (Day 1 Start) Important: Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of this product. Tablet Color: Drospirenone active tablets are white (Day 1 to Day 24). Drospirenone inert tablets are light pink (Day 25 to Day 28).Day 1 Start :\n\nTake the first white active tablet on the first day of menses.\nTake subsequent white active tablets once daily at the same time each day for a total of 24 days.\nTake one light pink inert tablet daily for 4 days and at time of day that active tablets were taken.\nBegin each subsequent pack on the same day of the week as the first cycle pack (i.e., on the day after taking the last inactive tablet).\n\nInstructions for switching of Drospirenone:\n\nSwitching from another contraceptive method to Drospirenone: Start Drospirenone.\nA Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC): On the day when the new pack of the previous COC would have started.\nTransdermal Patch: On the day when next application would have been scheduled.\nVaginal ring: On the day when next insertion would have been scheduled.\nInjection: On the day when next injection would have been scheduled.\nIntrauterine contraceptive: On the day of removal.\nImplant: On the day of removal.\n\r\nRefer to the Patient Information and Instructions for Use for additional instructions for counseling patient concerning proper use.",
    "Interaction": "Effects of Other Drugs on Hormonal Contraceptives: Substances Decreasing the Systemic Concentrations of Hormonal Contraceptives (HCs) and Potentially Diminishing the Efficacy of HCs. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the systemic concentrations of HCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of HCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugsor herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of HCs include efavirenz, phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between HCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel females to use an alternative non-hormonal method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with HCs, and to continue back-up non-hormonal contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.Substances Increasing the Systemic Concentrations of Hormonal Contraceptives (HCs): In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal females, once daily co-administration of Drospirenone 3 mg/ethinyl estradiol (EE) 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of Drospirenone systemic exposure. Influence of Drospirenone on Other Medicinal Products Based on in vitro studies and in vivo interaction studies in female volunteers using omeprazole, simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrate, an interaction of Drospirenone with the metabolism of other active substances is unlikely.Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in females taking Drospirenone with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration (for example, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Based on epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses, there is little or no increased risk of birth defects in the children of females who inadvertently use oral progestin during early pregnancy. Discontinue it if pregnancy occurs, because there is no reason to use hormonal contraceptives during pregnancy. Negligible amounts of Drospirenone are excreted in breast milk. Thus, at therapeutic doses of it, no effects on breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. General, no adverse effects have been found on milk production or on the health growth, or development of the infant with use of POPs.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hyperkalemia: Drospirenone, a progestin, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk females, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone is contraindicated in females with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (e.g. renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Females receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked prior to starting treatment and during the first treatment cycle. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in females at increased risk for hyperkalemia i.e., those females who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly with Drospirenone. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin. Monitor females taking Drospirenone who later develop medical conditions\u00a0 and/or begin medication that put them at an increased risk for hyperkalemia.Thromboembolic Disorders: Epidemiological studies have not indicated an association between progestin-only preparations and an increased risk of myocardial infarction, cerebral thromboembolism, or venous\u00a0 thromboembolism. It is unknown whether the risk of VTE is increased with Drospirenone alone; however, if there is a risk, it is expected to be lower than that of Drospirenone in combination with ethinyl estradiol. When prescribing Drosperinone, consider the increased risk of thromboembolism inherent in the postpartum period and in females with a history of thromboembolism. Discontinue Drosperinone if arterial or venous thromboembolic events occur. Consider discontinuing Drospirenone, if feasible, in case of Drospirenone prolonged immobilization due to surgery or illness.Bone Loss: Treatment with Drospirenone leads to decreased estradiol serum levels. It is unknown if this may cause a clinically relevant loss of bone mineral density.Liver Disease: Discontinue Drospirenone if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and Drospirenone causation has been excluded. Drospirenone is contraindicated in females with liver tumors, benign or malignant, or hepatic impairment.Ectopic Pregnancy: Be alert to the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in females who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain while on Drospirenone.Risk of Hyperglycemia in Patients with Diabetes: Some patients receiving progestins, including Drospirenone, may exhibit a decrease in insulin sensitivity. Therefore, patients with diabetes may be at greater risk of hyperglycemia\u00a0and may require additional medication adjustments or monitoring.Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Females using Drospirenone may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first three months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or two active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and perform appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.Depression: Carefully observe females for a history of depression and discontinue Drospirenone if depression recurs to a serious degree. Data on the association of progestin-oacontraceptive products with onset of depression and exacerbation of depression are limited.",

Hormone replacement therapy is indicated to eliminate these complaints. Of all physiological estrogens, E2 is the most potent one with the highest affinity to the estrogen receptor. Estrogen target organs include, in particular, uterus, hypothalamus, pituitary, vagina, breast, bones (osteoclasts).Other effects of estrogens include reduction of insulin and blood glucose concentrations local vasoactive effects mediated by receptors, and receptor-independent effects on vascular smooth muscle.

Maximal enzyme induction is generally not seen for 2-3 weeks but may then be sustained for at least 4 weeks after the cessation of drug therapy. In rare cases reduced E2 levels have been observed under the simultaneous use of certain antibiotics (e.g. penicillins and tetracycline).The main metabolites of DRSP are generated without involvement of the cytochrome P450 system. Inhibitors of this enzyme system are therefore unlikely to influence the metabolism of DRSP. Nevertheless, inhibitors of'CYP3A4, like cimetidine, ketoconazole and others, may inhibit the metabolism of E2. \n\nInteraction with alcohol\nAcute alcohol ingestion during use of HRT may lead to elevations\nKnown or suspected premalignant conditions or malignancies, if sex steroid-influenced\nPresence or history of liver tumors (benign or malignant)\nSevere hepatic disease\nPresence or history of severe renal disease as long as renal function values have not returned to normal\nAcute arterial thromboembolism (e.g. myocardialinfarction, stroke)\nActive deep venous thrombosis,thromboembolic disorders,or a documented history of these conditions\nA high risk of venous or arterial thrombosis\nSevere hypertriglyceridemia\nPregnancy or lactation (see section 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation)\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients",
    "Contraindications": "Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should not be started in the presence of any of the conditions listed below. The product should be stopped immediately, if any of the conditions appear during HRT use.\n\nUndiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding\nKnown or suspected cancer of the breast\nKnown or suspected premalignant conditions or malignancies, if sex steroid-influenced\n\r\nThe excess risk disappears within a few years after stopping HRT. HRT increases the density of mammographic images which may adversely affect the radiological detection of breast cancer in some cases.Endometrial cancer: Prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogens increases the risk of development of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. The addition of DRSP opposes the development of endometrial hyperplasia caused by estrogens.Liver tumors: In rare cases benign, and even more rarely, malignant liver tumors have been observed after the use of hormonal substances such as those contained in HRT products. In isolated cases, these tumors led to life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage.",
    "Side Effects": "The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with Ethinylestradiol & Drospirenone are breast pain, female genital tract bleeding and gastrointestinal and abdominal pains. They occur in >6% of users. Bleeding irregularities usually subside during continued treatment. The frequency of bleeding decreases with the duration of treatment. Serious adverse reactions are arterial and venous thromboembolic events as well as breast cancer",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Ethinylestradiol & Drospirenone must not be used during pregnancy and lactation. If pregnancy occurs during medication with Ethinylestradiol & Drospirenone, treatment must be discontinued immediately. Small amounts of DRSP are excreted with the milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Before initiating therapy, all conditions/risk factors mentioned below should be considered when determining the individual benefit/risk of treatment for the patient. During HRT use, therapy should be discontinued immediately in case a contraindication is discovered, as well as in the following situations:\n\nMigrainous or frequent and unusually severe headaches that occur for the first time or other symptoms that are possible prodromal of cerebrovascular occlusion.\nRecurrence of cholestatic jaundice or cholestatic pruritus which occurred first during pregnancy or previous use of sex steroids.\nSymptoms of a thrombotic event.\n\r\nIn the event of new onset or deterioration of the following conditions or risk factors, the individual benefit/risk analysis should be re-done, taking into consideration the possible necessity of discontinuing therapy. The potential for an increased synergistic risk of thrombosis should be considered in women who possess a combination of risk factors or exhibit a greater severity of an individual risk factor. This increased risk may be greater than a simple cumulative risk of the factors. HRT should not be prescribed in case of a negative risk benefit assessment.Venous thromboembolism: Both randomized-controlled and epidemiological studies have suggested an increased relative risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), i.e. deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Benefit/Risk should therefore be carefully weighed in consultation with the patient when prescribing HRT to women with a risk factor for VIE. Generally recognized risk factors for VTE include a personal history, a family history (the occurrence of VTE in a direct relative at a relatively early age may indicate genetic disposition) and severe obesity. The risk of VTE also increases with age. There is no consensus about the possible role of varicose veins in VTE. The risk of VTE may be temporarily increased with prolonged immobilization, major elective or post-traumatic surgery, or major trauma. Depending on the nature of the event and the duration of the immobilization, consideration should be given to a temporary discontinuation of HRT.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "This contains two active ingredients- Ethinylestradiol and Drospirenone. Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic version of estrogen and Drospirenone is a synthetic form of progesterone. The hormonal components of this preparation inhibit ovulation by suppressing gonadotropin release. Secondary mechanisms, which may contribute to the effectiveness of this tablet as a contraceptive, include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm penetration) and changes in the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).Drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid activity, counteracting estrogen-related sodium retention. In combination with Ethinyloestradiol, Drospirenone displays a favorable lipid profile with an increase in high-density lipoprotein HDL. Drospirenone exerts antiandrogenic activity and does not counteract the ethinyloestradiol-related sex hormone-binding globulin increase which is useful for binding and inactivating the endogenous androgens.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "Interactions between ethinylestradiol and other drugs may lead to decreased or increased ethinylestradiol concentrations, respectively. Decreased ethinylestradiol serum concentrations may cause an increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual irregularities and may possibly reduce efficacy of the oral contraceptive. Example of substances that may decrease serum ethinylestradiol concentrations include rifampicin, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, dexamethasone, griseofulvin, topiramate, some protease inhibitors, modafinil, ritonavir and barbiturates. Certain antibiotics including ampicillin, other penicillins and tetracyclines may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. During concomitant use of this tablet & other drugs that may lead to decreased ethinylestradiol serum concentrations, it is recommended that a non hormonal back-up method of contraception to be used in addition to the regular intake of this tablet.",
    "Contraindications": "This tablet should not be used:\n\nKnown or suspected pregnancy\nIf you have heart disease, clotting of blood in the vein\nIf you suffer from liver disease or jaundice\nIf you suffer from high blood pressure, migraine, feel something hard in your breast, diabetes with vascular involvement, experience excessive bleeding for which no reason has yet been ascertained\nThe presence or a history of venous or arterial thromboembolic events (e.g. deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction or of a cerebrovascular accident)\nHistory of migraine with focal neurological symptoms\nPancreatitis or a history thereof if associated with severe hypertriglyceridaemia\nSevere renal insufficiency or acute renal failure\nPresence or history of liver tumours (benign or malignant)\nUndiagnosed vagina! bleeding\nHypersensitivity to any of the components of this preparation.",

At the initial stage some women may experience side-effects like dizziness, headache, breast pain, nausea or unscheduled uterine bleeding. These symptoms may occur in >3% of users. After starting one brand of oral contraceptive tablets, if you feel any inconvenience such as migraine, changes in eyesight or speech, unusual pain or swelling in your legs, sharp chest pains or shortness of breath, rash, yellow skin or a rise in blood pressure take immediate advice from your doctor.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Use during pregnancy: This is contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnancy must be excluded before starting this tablet. If pregnancy occurs during use of this tablet, the preparation must be withdrawn immediately. Women who discontinue oral contraceptives with the intent of becoming pregnant, a non-hormonal method of contraception is recommended for three months before attempting to conceive.Use during lactation: Lactation may be influenced by combined pill as they may reduce the quantity and change the composition of breast milk, therefore the use of estrogen containing combined pill should generally not be recommended until the nursing mother has completely weaned her child. Small amounts of the contraceptive steroids and/or their metabolites may be excreted with the milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "If any circulatory disorder (like- myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular injury etc) or other risk factors(like smoking, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, migraine, atrial fibrillation etc) are present, the benefits of COC use should be weighed against the possible risks for each individual woman and discussed with the woman before she decides to start using it. In the event of aggravation, exacerbation or first appearance of any of these conditions or risk factors after taking pill, the woman should contact with her physician. The physician should then decide on whether its use should be discontinued.",

    "Indications": "This combination tablet is indicated in oral contraception.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "This is a combined oral contraceptive tablet containing the synthetic progestogen, drospirenone and the synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol. The contraceptive effect of this tablet is based on the interaction of various factors, the most important of which are seen as the inhibition of ovulation and the changes in cervical secretion. When this tablet is taken according to instructions, the egg cells are prevented from maturing to the point at which they can be fertilized, the cervical mucus remains thick so as to constitute a barrier to sperm and the endometrium is rendered unreceptive to implantation. As well as protection against pregnancy, estrogen/progestogen combinations have several positive properties which, next to the negative properties, can be useful in deciding on the method of birth control. The cycle is more regular and the menstruation is often less painful and bleeding is lighter.Drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid activity, counteracting estrogen related sodium retention. In combination with ethinylestradiol, drospirenone displays a favourable lipid profile with an increase in high-density lipoprotein HDL. Drospirenone exerts antiandrogenic activity and does not counteract the ethinylestradiol-related sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) increase which is useful for binding and inactivating the endogenous androgens. Drospirenone is devoid of any androgenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid and antiglucocorticoid activity. This in combination with the antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic properties, gives drospirenone a biochemical and pharmacological profile closely resembling the natural hormone progesterone.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Dutasteride is a dual inhibitor of 5\u03b1-reductase. It inhibits both type 1 and type 2, 5\u03b1-reductase isoenzymes, which are responsible for the conversion of testosterone to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for hyperplasia of glandular prostatic tissue.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose is Dutasteride 0.5 mg orally once daily. The capsules should be swallowed whole. Dutasteride may be administered with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for subjects with renal impairment or for the elderly. Due to the absence of data in patients with hepatic impairment, no dosage recommendation can be made.Pediatric use:\u00a0Dutasteride is not indicated for use in the pediatric population. Safety and\u00a0effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established.Geriatric use:\u00a0No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and\u00a0adult subjects.",
    "Interaction": "Care should be taken when administering Dutasteride to patients taking potent, chronic CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dutasteride does not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of model substrates for the major human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) at a concentration of 1,000 ng/ml, 25 times greater than steady-state serum concentrations in humans. In vitro studies demonstrate that Dutasteride does not displace Warfarin, Diazepam, or Phenytoin from plasma protein binding sites, nor do these model compounds displace Dutasteride.",
    "Contraindications": "Dutasteride is contra-indicated for use in women and children and for patients with known hypersensitivity to Dutasteride, and other 5 a-reductase inhibitors. Warnings: Exposure of women-risk to male fetus: Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin. Therefore, women who are pregnant or may be pregnant should not handle Dutasteride capsules because of the possibility of absorption of Dutasteride and the potential risk of a fetal anomaly to a male fetus. If contact is made with leaking capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water.",

    "Precautions & Warnings": "General:\u00a0Lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH can be indicative of other urological\u00a0diseases, including prostate cancer. Patients should be assessed to rule out other urological\u00a0diseases prior to treatment with Dutasteride. Patients with a large residual urinary volume\u00a0and/or severely diminished urinary flow may not be good candidates for 5 a-reductase inhibitor\u00a0therapy and should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. Blood Donation: Men being\u00a0treated with Dutasteride should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following\u00a0their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of Dutasteride to\u00a0a pregnant female transfusion recipient.Use in hepatic impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on Dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Because Dutasteride is extensively metabolized and has a half-life of approximately 5 weeks at steady state, caution should be used in the administration of Dutasteride to patients with liver disease.Effects on prostate-specific antigen and prostate cancer detection: Digital rectal examinations, as well as other evaluations for prostate cancer, should be performed on patients with BPH prior to initiating therapy with Dutasteride and periodically thereafter. Dutasteride reduces total serum PSA concentration by approximately 40% following 3 months of treatment and approximately 50% following 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values, although it may vary in individual patients.",

    "Dosage & Administration": "Eflornithine cream should be applied to the affected area twice daily, at least eight hours apart. Efficacy has only been demonstrated for affected areas of the face and under the chin. The application should be limited to these areas. Maximal applied doses used safely in clinical trials were up to 30 grams per month. Improvement in the condition may be noticed within eight weeks of starting treatment. Continued treatment may result in further improvement and is necessary to maintain beneficial effects. The condition may return to pre-treatment levels within eight weeks following discontinuation of treatment. Use should be discontinued if no beneficial effects are noticed within four months of commencing therapy. Patients may need to continue to use a hair removal method (e.g. shaving or plucking) in conjunction with Eflornithine cream. In that case, the cream should be applied no sooner than five minutes after shaving or use of other hair removal methods, as increased stinging or burning may otherwise occur.Elderly: (>65 years) No dosage adjustment is necessary.Pediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Eflornithine in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. There is no data available to support use in this age group.Hepatic/renal impairment: The safety and efficacy of Eflornithine in women with hepatic or renal impairment have not been established. As the safety of Eflornithine has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment, caution should be used when prescribing Eflornithine cream for these patients. A thin layer of the cream should be applied to clean and dry affected areas. The cream should be rubbed in thoroughly. The medicinal product should be applied such that no visual residual product remains on the treated areas after rub-in. Hands should be washed after applying this medicinal product. For maximal efficacy, the treated area should not be cleansed within four hours of application. Cosmetics (including sunscreens) can be applied over the treated areas, but no sooner than five minutes after application.",
    "Interaction": "No interaction studies have been performed.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Excessive hair growth can result from serious underlying disorders (e.g. polycystic ovary syndrome, androgen secreting neoplasm) or certain active substances (e.g. cyclosporin, glucocorticoids, minoxidil, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, combined oestrogen-androgen hormone replacement therapy). These factors should be considered in the overall medical treatment of patients who might be prescribed Eflornithine. Eflornithine is for cutaneous use only. Contact with eyes or mucous membranes (e.g. nose or mouth) should be avoided. Transient stinging or burning may occur when the cream is applied to abraded or broken skin.",
    "Side Effects": "Adverse events were primarily mild in intensity and generally resolved without medical treatment or discontinuation of Eflornithine. Side effects can include acne, barbae, pseudofolliculitis, stinging skin, headache, burning skin, dry skin, erythema (redness), pruritus (itching), tingling skin, dyspepsia, skin irritation, rash, alopecia, dizziness, folliculitis, hair ingrown, facial edema, anorexia, nausea, asthenia, vertigo.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "pregnancy: Throughout clinical trials data from a limited number of exposed pregnancies (22) indicate that there is no clinical evidence that treatment with Eflornithine adversely affects mothers or foetuses. Among the 22 pregnancies that occurred during the trials, only 19 pregnancies occurred while the patient was using Eflornithine. Of these 19 pregnancies, there were 9 healthy infants, 5 elective abortions, 4 spontaneous abortions and 1 birth defect (Down\u2019s Syndrome to a 35 year old). Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity. The potential risk to humans is unknown. Therefore, women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should use an alternative means to manage facial hair.Lactation: It is not known whether eflornithine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Women should not use Eflornithine whilst breastfeeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "If skin irritation or intolerance develops, the frequency of application should be reduced temporarily to once a day. If irritation continues, treatment should be discontinued and the physician consulted.",

Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Calcium Carbonate is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Calcium Carbonate containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.1000 mg tablet: Elemental Calcium tablet is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO3+2HCl = CaCl2+H2O+CO2. Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion.

    "name": "Emicizumab",
    "generic_id": "2222",
    "Indications": "Emicizumab is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody indicated for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients ages newborn and older with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with or without factor VIII inhibitors.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Emicizumab mimics the function of coagulation factor VIII, therefore it binds to the activated form of Factor IX (Factor IXa). This binding forms a complex that will later bind to the X factor of the coagulation factor. The ability of Emicizumab to interact with both factors (Factor IXa and Factor X) activates the coagulation cascade that will subsequently lead to the segmentation of fibrinogen into fibrin and the formation of blood clots. The effect of Emicizumab is translated into the restoration of the blood coagulation process and, therefore, in the reduction of hemorrhagic episodes. The activity of emicizumab can also produce changes in activated clotting time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and one-step Factor VIII activity. In addition, the unique bispecific structure of Emicizumab prevents the formation of Factor VIII inhibitors or their effect.Emicizumab exerts its action by performing the function of the coagulation Factor VIII without presenting a structural homology. It presents a dual specificity which allows it to bind to both the Factor IXa and Factor X, performing the required bridging activity for the launch of the coagulation cascade.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended loading dose is 3 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of:\n\n1.5 mg/kg once every week, or\n3 mg/kg once every two weeks, or\n6 mg/kg once every four weeks.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: There are no available data on emicizumab use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with emicizumab-kxwh. It is not known whether emicizumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Emicizumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of emicizumab-kxwh in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Linagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme which declines the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output.Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from kidney back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, Empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Enalapril, after hydrolysis to enalaprilate, inhibits Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of enalapril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The maximum daily dose is 40 mg. The absorption of Enalapril is not affected by food. Essential and renovascular hypertension: Treatment should be initiated with 5 mg once a day. Where concomitant therapy is a diuretic, the recommended initial dose of Enalapril 2.5 mg. The dose should be titrated to give optimum control of blood pressure.The usual maintenance dose is 10-20 mg given once daily. In severe hypertension, the dosage may be increased incrementally to a maximum of 40 mg once daily. The dosage of other antihypertensive agents being used together with Enalapril may need to be adjusted. Where Enalapril replaces a beta-blocking drug in the therapeutic regimen, the beta-blocking agent should not be discontinued abruptly; the dosage should be titrated down after commencing therapy with Enalapril.With concomitant diuretic therapy: The recommended initial dose of Enalapril is 2.5 mg. Symptomatic hypotension can occur following the initial dose of Enalapril; this is more likely when Enalapril is added to previous diuretic therapy. Caution is recommended, therefore, since these patients may be volume or salt depleted. If possible,the diuretic therapy should be discontinued for 2-3 days prior to initiation of therapy with Enalapril. Enalapril minimises the development of thiazide-induced hypokalaemia and hyperuricaemia.Use in the elderly (over 65 years): The starting dose should be 2.5 mg. Enalapril is effective in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly. Some elderly patients may be more responsive to Enalapril than younger patients. The dose should be titrated according to need for the control of blood pressure.Heart failure: Enalapril can be used as an adjunctive therapy with non-potassium-sparing diuretics and /or digitalis. Enalapril should be introduced for the treatment of heart failure following stabilisation of the patient on diuretic therapy. Therapy with Enalapril should be initiated under close medical supervision (in hospital for severe heart failure) with a recommended starting dose of 2.5 mg once daily.The dose of Enalapril should be gradually increased depending upon tolerability to the recommended maintenance dose (10-20 mg) given as a single or twice daily dose. This dosage schedule has been shown to improve survival. In order to decrease the possibility of symptomatic hypotension, patients on previous high dose diuretics should have the diuretic dose reduced before introducing Enalapril, The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of Enalapril dose not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective treatment of the hypotension.Use in impaired renal function: Enalapril is excreted by kidney. It should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. The recommended starting dose is 2.5 mg. The dose should be titrated against the response, and should be kept as low as possible to maintain adequate control of blood pressure or heart failure. Enalapril is dialysable. Dialysis patients may be given the usual dose of Enalaprilon dialysis. On the days when patients are not on dialysis the dosage should be tailored to the blood pressure response.Children: The paediatric use of Enalapril has not been studied.",
    "Interaction": "Combination with other antihypertensive agents such as beta-blockers, methyldopa, calcium antagonists, and diuretics may increase the antihypertensive efficacy. Adrenergic - blocking drugs should only be combined with Enalapril under careful supervision, Concomitant propranolol may reduce the bioavailability of Enalapril, but this does not appear to be of any clinical significance. Plasma potassium usually remains within normal limits, although cases of hyperkalaemia have been reported. If Enalapril is given with potassium losing diuretic, the likelihood of diuretic-induced hypokalaemia may be lessened. Enalapril may elevate plasma potassium levels in patients with renal failure. Potassium supplements, potassium-containing saft substitutes are not recommended, particularly in patients with impaired renal function, since they may lead to significant increases in plasma potassium.",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the product or any of its components, and in patients with a history of angioneurotic oedema relating to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor.",
    "Side Effects": "Severe hypotension and renal failure have occurred in association with therapy with Enalapril. These appear to occur in certain specific sub-groups. Other adverse reactions include dizziness, headache, fatigue, asthenia, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, nausea, diarrhoea, muscle cramps, rash, cough. Less frequently renal dysfunction, renal failure, and oliguria have been reported.

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Enalapril has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits during middle and late pregnancy. Because of these findings Enalapril is contra-indicated in pregnancy. Enalapril and enalaprilat are excreted in human milk; caution should be exercised if Enalapril is given to lactating mothers.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Pretreatment assessment of renal function: Assessment of renal function prior to initiation of therapy, and during treatment where appropriate. Symptomatic hypotension was seen rarely in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. It has been reported mainly in patients with severe heart failure and who have been volume-depleted by diuretic therapy. By initiating therapy with a small dose (2.5 mg Enalapril) the duration of any hypotensive effect may be lessened. Similar considerations in terms of initiating therapy with a small dose may apply also to patients with ischaemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom severe hypotension could result in a myocardial infarct or cerebrovascular accident. Severe hypotension has been reported, mainly in patients with severe heart failure with or without associated renal insufficiency. This is most likely in those patients on high doses of loop diuretics, or with hyponatraemia or functional renal impairment. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of Enalapril does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug after effective management of the hypotention.Impaired renal function: Enalapril should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency as they may require reduced or less frequent doses. As with all antihypertensive agents, renal function should be assessed in patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure before initiating therapy. Angioneurotic oedema has been reported with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including Enalapril. In such cases, Enalapril should be discontinued immediately and appropriate monitoring should be instituted to ensure complete resolution of symptoms prior to dismissing the patient. Haemodialysis patients: A high incidence of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high flux membranes (e.g., AN 69) and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. This combination should therefore be avoided. Cough: Cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. Characteristically, the cough is non-productive, persistent and resolves after discontinuation of therapy. Surgery/Anaesthesia: In patients undergoing major surgery or during anaesthesia with agents that produce hypotension. Enalapril blocks angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. This may lead to hypotension which can be corrected by volume expansion. Enalapril should not be used in patients with aortic stenosis or outflow obstruction.",

Aldosterone synthesis, which occurs primarily in the adrenal gland, is modulated by multiple factors, including angiotensin II and non-RAAS mediators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone and potassium. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g. kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g. heart, blood vessels, and brain) tissues and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorption and possibly other mechanisms. Eplerenone has been shovvn to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone, consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion. The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of Eplerenone.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Congestive heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction: The recommended dose of Eplerenone is 50 mg once daily. Treatment should be initiated at 25 mg once daily and titrated to the target dose of 50 mg once daily preferably within 4 weeks as tolerated by the patient. Eplerenone may be administered with or without food.Hypertension:\u00a0Eplerenone may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. The recommended starting dose of Eplerenone is 50 mg administered once daily. For patients with an inadequate blood pressure response to 50mg once daily the dosage of Eplerenone should be increased to 50mg twice daily. Higher dosages of Eplerenone are not recommended either because they have no greater effect on blood pressure than 100 mg or because they are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.Pediatric use:\u00a0The safety and effectiveness of Eplerenone has not been established in pediatric patients.Geriatric use:\u00a0No differences in overall incidence of effectivity or safety was observed in elderly patients.",
    "Interaction": "May increase risk of hyperkalaemia with ACE inhibitors and/or angiotension receptor blocker, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, trimethoprim. May reduce antihypertensive effect with NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, tetracosactide. May enhance hypotensive effect of \u03b11-blockers (e.g. alfuzosin, prazosin), TCAs, amifostine, baclofen, neuroleptics. May increase plasma level with mild to moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, amiodarone, diltiazem, verapamil).",
    "Contraindications": "Eplerenone is contraindicated in hyperkalemia, severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min), severe hepatic impairment. Concomitant use with potent CYPBA4 inhibitors like Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Nefazodone, Troleandomycin, Clarithromycin, Ritonavir, and Nelfinavir or other potassium-sparing diuretics are also contraindicated.",
    "Side Effects": "Headache, dizziness, diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, cough or flu-like symptoms may occur. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction like: rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing can occur.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Eplerenone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The concentration of Eplerenone in human breast milk after oral administration is unknown. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the unknown potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Eplerenone should be used with caution in hyperkalemia, severe kidney disease, diabetic patients with congestive heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction including those with proteinuria.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Potassium-sparing diuretics, Potassium-sparing diuretics & Aldosterone antagonists",

    "Precautions & Warnings": "In patients undergoing PCI, Eptifibatide Injection is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding at the site of arterial sheath placement. Special care should be employed to minimize the risk of bleeding among these patients.If bleeding cannot be controlled with pressure, infusion of Eptifibatide and concomitant heparin should be stopped immediately.Because Eptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation, caution should be employed when it is used with drugs that affect hemostasis, including thrombolytics, oral anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and dipyridamole.Use with other GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors should be avoided.Eptifibatide is cleared in part by the kidney and its plasma concentrations are doubled in patients with renal disease (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min). Therefore, the infusion dose of Eptifibatide needs to be reduced to 1 mcg/kg/min in these patients. Eptifibatide is contraindicated in patients who are dependent upon renal dialysis.Caution should be exercised when administering eptifibatide to patients with a platelet count <100,000/mm3.Bleeding is the most common complication encountered during Eptifibatide therapy. The majority of excess major bleeding events were localized at the femoral artery access site. Oropharyngeal, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and retroperitoneal bleeding were seen more commonly with eptifibatide compared with placebo.Arterial and venous punctures, intramuscular injections, and the use of urinary catheters, nasotracheal intubation, and nasogastric tubes should be minimized. When obtaining intravenous access, noncompressible sites (e.g., subclavian or jugular veins) should be avoided.Before infusion of Eptifibatide, the following laboratory tests should be performed to identify preexisting hemostatic abnormalities: hematocrit or hemoglobin, platelet count, serum creatinine, and PT/aPTT.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Ertapenem for Injection is a sterile, synthetic, long-acting, parenteral, 1-\u03b2 methyl-carbapenem that is structurally related to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, with activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action. It works by binding to and inhibiting bacterial penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). In Escherichia coli, it has a strong affinity toward PBPs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with preferential binding to PBPs 2 and 3. Upon binding to PBPs, ertapenem inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with the lengthening and strengthening of the peptidoglycan portion of the cell wall, thereby inhibiting cell wall synthesis.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Not available",
    "Interaction": "When Ertapenem is administered with probenecid, probenecid competes for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of Ertapenem. This leads to small but statistically significant increases in the elimination half-life (19%) and in the extent of systemic exposure (25%). No dosage adjustment is necessary when Ertapenem is given with probenecid. Because of the small effect on half-life, the co-administration with probenecid to extend the half-life of Ertapenem is not recommended. Other than with probenecid, no specific clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted. Decreased serum levels of valproic acid with co-administration of Ertapenem have been reported. Careful monitoring of serum levels of valproic acid should be considered if Ertapenem is to be co-administered with valproic acid.",
    "Contraindications": "Ertapenem is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of this product or to other drugs in the same class or in patients who have demonstrated anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactams. Due to the use of lidocaine HCl as a diluent, intramuscular administration of Ertapenem is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to local anaesthetics of the amide type and in patients with severe shock or heart block.",
    "Side Effects": "Most adverse experiences reported in these clinical studies were described as mild to moderate in severity. The most common drug-related adverse experiences reported during parenteral therapy with Ertapenem include Headache, Infused vein complication, phlebitis/ thrombophlebitis, Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.Other uncommon side effects include- Dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, seizure, confusion, Extravasation, hypotension, Dyspnoea, Oral candidiasis, constipation, acid regurgitation, C. difficile-associated diarrhoea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, anorexia, Erythema, pruritus, Abdominal pain, taste perversion, asthenia/fatigue, candidiasis, oedema/swelling, fever, pain, chest pain, Vaginal pruritus.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Ertapenem has been assigned to pregnancy category B by the FDA. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ertapenem should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and foetus. Ertapenem is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Ertapenem is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Before initiating therapy with Ertapenem, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other beta-lactams and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to Ertapenem occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment.As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of Ertapenem may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including Ertapenem, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of \"antibiotic-associated colitis\".",

Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be risk to the developing human kidney. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, advise women that the use of Ertugliflozin is not recommended while breastfeeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Ketoacidosis: Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization, have been identified in clinical trials and post marketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and cases have been reported in Ertugliflozin treated patients in clinical trials. Across the clinical program, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 of 3,409 (0.1%) of Ertugliflozin treated patients and 0% of comparator-treated patients. Fatal cases ofketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients treated with Ertugliflozin who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with Ertugliflozin may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, Ertugliflozin should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement.General: Ertugliflozin is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.Hypotension: Ertugliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. Therefore, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating Ertugliflozin particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Use In Specific Populations], elderly patients (>65 years), in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating Ertugliflozin, volume status should be assessed and corrected if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy.Acute Kidney Injury And Impairment In Renal Function: Ertugliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction and can cause renal impairment. There have been post marketing reports of acute kidney injury some requiring hospitalization and dialysis in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Before initiating Ertugliflozin, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing Ertugliflozin in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue Ertugliflozin promptly and institute treatment. Ertugliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating Ertugliflozin. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating Ertugliflozin and periodically thereafter. Use of Ertugliflozin is not recommended when eGFR ispersistently between 30 and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 Hypoglycemia With Concomitant Use With Insulin And Insulin SecretogoguesInsulin and insulin secretogogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Ertugliflozin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretogogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretogogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Ertugliflozin.Increases In Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C): Dose-related increases in LDL-C can occur with Ertugliflozin. Monitor and treat as appropriate.Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Ertugliflozin.",

    "Pharmacology": "Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.Absorption: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.Distribution: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.Excretion: 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and Children over 8 years: 250-500 mg every six hours for mild to moderate infections.

Children aged 2 to 8 years: 250 mg. every six hours or 30-50 mg/kg body weight per day divided into four equal dosage. Infants and Children upto 2 years: 500 mg. in divided doses or 30-50 mg/kg body weight in divided doses.",
    "Interaction": "Recent data from studies of erythromycin reveals that its use in patients who are receiving high dosage of theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In such cases this dose of theophylline should be reduced.",
    "Contraindications": "Known hypersensitivity to Erythromycin.",

It acts as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiation hormone.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Therapy with Recormon should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. As anaphylactoid reactions were observed in isolated cases, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.Substitution by any other biological medicinal product requires the consent of the prescribing physician.The Recormon pre-filled syringe is ready for use. Only solutions which are clear or slightly opalescent, colourless and practically free of visible particles may be injected.Recormon in pre-filled syringe is a sterile but unpreserved product. Under no circumstances should more than one dose be administered per syringe.Treatment of anemic patients with chronic renal failure: The solution can be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. In case of intravenous administration, the solution should be injected over approximately 2 minutes, e.g. in hemodialysis patients via the arteriovenous fistula at the end of dialysis.For non-hemodialysed patients, subcutaneous administration should always be preferred in order to avoid puncture of peripheral veins.The recommended hemoglobin target is 10 -12 g/dl. The target hemoglobin should be determined individually in the presence of hypertension or existing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular diseases. It is recommended that hemoglobin is monitored at regular intervals (e.g. every two to four weeks) until stabilised and periodically thereafter.Treatment with Recormon is divided into two stages: Correction phase-Subcutaneous administration: The initial dosage is 3 x 20 IU/kg body weight per week. The dosage may be increased every 4 weeks by 3 X 20 IU/kg body weight/week if the Hb increase is not adequate (Hb <1.5 g/L per week). The weekly dose can also be divided into daily doses.Intravenous administration: The initial dosage is 3 x 40 IU/kg per week. The dosage may be raised after 4 weeks to 80 IU/kg - three times per week- and by further increments of 20 IU/kg if needed, three times per week, at monthly intervals.For both routes of administration, the maximum dose should not exceed 720 IU/kg per week.",
    "Interaction": "No dedicated clinical interaction studies have been performed. Clinical experience has not given evidence for potential interaction of Recormon with other medicinal products.

Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole\u2019s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1\u20131.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hoursAmoxicillin\u00a0is similar to\u00a0penicillin\u00a0in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.Clarithromycin\u00a0acts by inhibiting microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms mainly by binding to the donor site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and preventing translocation to that site.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Not available",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Hormone therapy should only be continued as long as the benefit in alleviation of severe symptoms outweighs the risk. A complete medical history should be taken and a physical examination should be conducted prior to the initiation or reinstitution of HRT, should be repeated periodically. The frequency and nature of these examinations should be based on established practice guidelines, 6 monthly reviews are generally considered appropriate, and be adapted to the individual woman, but should generally include pelvic organs, including routine cervical cytology, abdomen, breasts and blood pressure. The need for continued therapy should be reconsidered at each review. Unless otherwise prescribed by the doctor, 1 tablet Estradiol is taken daily and the tablets are to be swallowed whole with some liquid. Each pack covers 30 days and treatment is continuous, which means that the next pack follows immediately without a break. It does not matter at what time of the day the patient takes her tablet, but once she has selected a particular time, she should keep it to every day. If she forgets to take a tablet at the usual time, she may take it within the following 12 to 24 hours. If the treatment is discontinued for longer, irregular bleeding may occur.Treatment may be started at any time provided that pregnancy has been excluded. High-dosed and long-term use of unopposed oestrogens during the climacteric may increase the incidence of endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial hyperplasia should be avoided in unopposed oestrogen treatment. It is therefore mandatory to add a progestogen for the last 10-14 days of each month of therapy. As a general rule, Estradiol treatment should be discontinued every 6 months in order to verify the persistence of complaints requiring treatment. It is essential to adhere to the dosage scheme prescribed by the doctor and to keep the appointments made for gynaecological check-ups.",
    "Interaction": "Interaction with laboratory tests: The use of sex steroids may influence biochemical parameters of, for example, liver, thyroid, adrenal and renal function, plasma levels of (carrier) proteins such as corticosteroid-binding globulin and lipid/lipoprotein fractions, parameters of carbohydrate metabolism, and parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis.Interactions with other medicines: Long-term treatment with hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g. several anticonvulsants and antimicrobials) can increase the clearance of sex hormones and may reduce clinical efficacy. Such hepatic enzyme-inducing properties have been established for hydantoins, barbiturates, primidone, carbamazepine, and rifampicin and are also suspected for oxcarbazepine, topiramate, felbamate, griseofulvin and the herbal remedy St John\u2019s Wort (hypericum perforatum). Maximal enzyme induction is generally not seen before 2-3 weeks but may be sustained for at least 4 weeks after cessation of drug therapy. In rare cases, reduced oestradiol levels have been observed under the simultaneous use of certain antibiotics (e.g. penicillins and tetracycline). Substances which undergo substantial conjugation (e.g. paracetamol) may increase the bioavailability of oestradiol by competitive inhibition of the conjugation system during absorption. In individual cases, the requirement for oral antidiabetics or insulin can change as a result of the effect on glucose tolerance.",

    "generic_id": "1832",
    "Indications": "Estradiol Valerate tablet is indicated in Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for estrogen deficiency symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women. It is used for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of future fracture.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Estradiol enters target cells freely (e.g., female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) and interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. Increases in the down-stream effects of Estrogen Receptor binding reverses some of the symptoms of menopause, which are primarily caused by a loss of estrogenic activity.Absorption: After oral administration estradiol valerate is quickly and completely absorbed.Metabolism: Exogenous estrogens are metabolized using the same mechanism as endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are partially metabolized by cytochrome P450.Excretion: Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Estradiol Valerate is an estrogen-only product. 1 mg tablet to be taken daily. It does not matter at what time of day the woman takes her tablet, but once she has selected a particular time she should keep to it every day. Treatment is continuous, which means that the next pack follows immediately without a break.For initiation and continuation of treatment of menopausal symptoms, the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration should be used. Treatment to control menopausal symptoms should be initiated with Estradiol Valerate 1 mg tablet. If considered necessary, Estradiol Valerate 2 mg should be used. Once treatment is established the lowest effective does necessary for relief of symptoms should be used.In women with an intact uterus, a progestogen should be added to Estradiol Valerate 1 mg for at least 12-14 days each month/28 day cycle. Unless there is a previous diagnosis of endometriosis, it is not recommended to add a progestogen in hysterectomised women.How to start Estradiol Valerate 1 mg: If the woman has an intact uterus and is still menstruating, a combination regimen with Valest and a progestogen, commencing with the oestrogen phase, should begin on the first day of bleeding. If the menstrual periods are very infrequent or if amenorrhoea is established, she may start at any time provided, if appropriate, pregnancy has been excluded.In women transferring from a continuous combined HRT product, treatment with Estradiol Valerate may be started on any day. In women transferring from cyclic or continuous sequential HRT regimens the woman should complete the cycle and then change to\u00a0without a break in therapy.Missed or lost tablets: If the woman forgets to take a tablet at the usual time, she may take it within the following 12 hours. If the woman is more than 12 hours late the forgotten tablet should not be taken and the remaining tablets taken at the usual time on the right days. A missed dose may lead to breakthrough bleeding or spotting.Pediatric population: Not recommended for childrenMethod of administration: The tablets can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water or milk. The tablets should be taken at the same time each day.",

The results of most epidemiological studies to date relevant to inadvertent foetal exposure to oestrogens indicate no teratogenic or foetotoxic effects. This is not indicated during breast-feeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "For the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, HRT should only be initiated for symptoms that adversely affect quality of life. In all cases, a careful appraisal of the risk and benefits should be undertaken at least annually and HRT should only be continued as long as the benefit outweighs the risk.Evidence regarding the risks associated with HRT in the treatment of premature menopause is limited. Due to the low level of absolute risk in younger women, however, the balance of benefits and risks for these women may be more favorable than in older women. Medical examination/follow-up:Before initiating or reinstituting HRT, a complete personal and family medical history should be taken. Physical (including pelvic and breast) examination should be guided by this and by the contraindications and warnings for use. During treatment, periodic check-ups are recommended of a frequency and nature adapted to the individual woman. Women should be advised what changes in their breasts should be reported to their doctor or nurse (see 'Breast cancer' below). Investigations, including appropriate imaging tools, e.g mammography, should be carried out in accordance with currently accepted screening practices, modified to the clinical needs of the individual.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Estriol induces the normalization of the vaginal epithelium and thus helps to restore the normal microflora and the physiological pH in the vagina. As a result, it increases the resistance of the vaginal epithelial cells to infection and inflammation. In comparison to other estrogens, estriol is short acting. In the years just before and after the menopause (which can be natural or surgically induced) estriol can be used in the treatment of symptoms and complaints related to estrogen deficiency. Estriol is particularly used in the treatment of urogenital symptoms.After oral administration, estriol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma levels of unconjugated estriol are reached within 1 hr of administration. Nearly all (90%) estriol is bound to albumin in the plasma and unlike other estrogens; estriol is hardly bound to sex hormone-binding globulin. The metabolism of estriol consists mainly of conjugation and deconjugation during enterohepatic circulation. Estriol, a metabolic end product, is mainly excreted via the urine in the conjugated form. Only a small fraction is excreted via the feces, mainly as unconjugated estriol.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "It is important that the total daily dose is taken at one time. It may be taken with or without food. \n\nAtropy of the lower urogenital tract: 4-8 mg/day for the first weeks, followed by a gradual reduction, based on relief of symptoms, until a maintenance dosage (e.g. 1-2 mg/day) is reached.\nPre and postoperative therapy in postmenopausal women undergoing vaginal surgery: 4-8 mg/day in the 2 weeks before surgery; 1-2 mg/day in the 2 weeks after surgery.\nClimacteric complaints such as hot flushes and night sweating: 4-8 mg/day during the first weeks, followed by a gradual reduction. For maintenance therapy the lowest effective dosage should be used.\nA diagnostic aid in case of a doubtful atrophic cervical smear: 2-4 mg/day for 7 days before taking the next smear.\nInfertility due to cervical hostility: In general 1-2 mg/day on days 6-15 of the menstrual cycle. However, for some patients dosages as low as 1 mg/day are sufficient, whereas others may need up to 8 mg/day. Therefore, the dosage should be increased each month until an optimal effect on the cervical mucus is obtained.",
    "Interaction": "There are strong indications that estrogens, estriol included, can increase the pharmacologic effects of certain corticosteroids. If necessary, the dosage of the corticosteroid should be reduced. There are also some indications, mainly obtained with other estrogens or oral contraceptives, that concurrent use of estriol with activated charcoal, barbiturates, hydantoins and rifampicin may possibly decrease the effectiveness of estriol.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in pregnancy, known or suspected estrogen-dependent tumours, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, untreated endometrial hyperplasia, known or suspected breast cancer.",
    "Side Effects": "Breast tension or pain, nausea, spotting, fluid retention and cervical hypersecretion may occasionally occur and be indicative of too high dosage. Headache, hypertension, leg cramps and vision disturbances are seldom observed. In general, most of these adverse reactions disappear after the 1 st week of treatment.Breast enlargement, vaginal candidiasis, change in vaginal bleeding pattern, vomiting, stomach cramps, cholestatic jaundice, chloasma or melasma, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, hemorrhagic eruption, mental depression, chorea, increasing or decreasing body weight, edema, changes in libido.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Estriol is contraindicated during pregnancy. Use Estriol in breastfeeding women only if really needed, as estriol is excreted in the milk and it may decrease the quality and quantity of the milk production.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "During prolonged treatment with estrogens, periodic medical examinations are advisable. With vaginal infections, a concomitant specific treatment is recommended. In order to prevent endometrial stimulation, the daily dose should not exceed 8 mg nor should this maximum dose be used for longer than several weeks. Patients with any of the following conditions should be monitored: A history of latent or overt cardiac failure, fluid retention due to renal dysfunction, hypertension, epilepsy or migraine (or a history of these conditions), severe liver disorders, endometriosis, fibrocystic mastopathy, porphyria, hyperlipoproteinaemia, a history during pregnancy or previous use of steroids of severe pruritus, cholestatic jaundice or herpes gestationis.

A thrombosis sometimes occurs in the deep veins of the legs (deep venous thrombosis). If this blood clot breaks away from the veins where it is formed, it may reach and block the arteries of the lungs, causing a so-called \"Pulmonary embolism.\" Deep venous thrombosis is a rare occurrence. It can develop whether or not you are taking the Pill. It can also happen if you become pregnant. The risk is higher in Pill-users than in non-users, but it is not as high as the risk during pregnancy.Blood clots can also occur very rarely in the blood vessels of the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). Extremely rarely blood clots can occur in the liver, gut, kidney or eye.Very occasionally a thrombosis may cause serious permanent disabilities or may even be fatal.The risk of having a heart attack or stroke increases, as you get older. It also increases the more you smoke. When using the Pill you should stop smoking, especially if you are older than about 35 years of age.If you develop high blood pressure while using the Pill, you may be told to stop using it.The risk of having a deep venous thrombosis is temporarily increased as a result of an operation or immobilisation (for example, when you have your leg or legs in plaster or splints). In women who use the Pill, the risk may be yet higher. Tell your doctor you are using the Pill well in advance of any expected hospitalisation or surgery. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking the Pill several weeks before surgery or at the time of immobilisation. Your doctor will also tell you when you can start taking the Pill again after you are back on your feet. If you notice possible signs of a thrombosis, stop taking the Pill and consult your doctor immediately.The Pill and cancer: Breast cancer has been diagnosed, slightly more often in women who use the Pill than in women of the same age who do not use the Pill. This slight increase in the numbers of breast cancer diagnoses gradually disappears during the course of the 10 years after stopping use of the Pill. It is not known whether the difference is caused by the Pill. It may be that the women were examined more often, so that the breast cancer was noticed earlier. In rare cases benign liver tumours and even more rarely, malignant liver tumours have been reported in users of the Pill. These tumours may lead to internal bleeding. Contact your doctor immediately if you have severe pain in your stomach.Cervical cancer has been reported to occur more often in women using the Pill for a long time. This finding may not be caused by the Pill but may be related to sexual behaviour and other factors.The Pill and other Medicines: Some medicines may stop the Pill from working properly. These include medicines used for the treatment of epilepsy (eg. primidone, phenytoin, barbiturates) and tuberculosis (eg. rifampicin); and antibiotics (eg. ampcillin, tetracyclines, griseofulvin) for some other infectious diseases. Always tell the doctor, who prescribes the Pill, which medicines you are already using. Also tell any other doctor or dentist who prescribes another medicine (or the dispensing pharmacist) that you use this tablet. They can tell you if you need to take additional contraceptive precautions and if so, for how long.The Pill and Ability to Drive: There are no observed effects.",

Secondary mechanisms, which may contribute to the effectiveness of Gestop 28 as a contraceptive, include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm penetration) and changes in the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).",
    "Dosage & Administration": "How to Take this pill: To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Gestodene & Ehinylestradiol must be taken in the order directed on the package and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.

Discard the unfinished pack of tablets and start taking tablets from the very first white tablet of the top row from a fresh pack from the first day of next menstruation.\u00a0\nHow to Delay a Period: To delay a period you should continue with another new pack of Gestodene & Ehinylestradiol just after finishing the white active tablet of the present pack (that is no need to take light redplacebo tablet of present pack).

While using the second pack woman may have some breakthrough bleeding or spotting.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The active ingredient, Ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate 12.5% w/w (IR 3535) is a technical grade synthetic biochemical that is produced by an integrated process. It is a substituted \u00df-amino acid structurally similar to naturally occurring \u00df-alanine. No harmful effects to humans or the environment are expected from this use of 3-[N-Butyl-N-acetyl] aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester.Biochemical Description: In 1997, EPA-OPP's Biochemical Classification Committee classified IR 3535 as a biochemical, based on facts that it is functionally identical to naturally occurring beta alanine in that both repel insects, the basic molecular structure is identical, the end groups are not likely to contribute to toxicity and it acts to control the target insects via a non-toxic mode of action. Assessing Risks to Human Health: IR 3535 has been used as an insect repellent in Europe for 30 years with no substantial adverse effects. Toxicity tests show that the IR 3535 is not harmful when ingested, inhaled, or used on skin. Eye irritation could occur if the chemical enters a person\u2019s eyes. Any allergic reactions are required to be reported.Assessing Risks to the Environment: Because the active ingredient is used only in products applied to human skin, no risks to the environment are expected.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Similar to other NSAIDs, the anti-inflammatory effects of etodolac result from inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase (COX). This decreases the synthesis of peripheral prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation. Etodolac binds to the upper portion of the COX enzyme active site and prevents its substrate, arachidonic acid, from entering the active site. Etodolac was previously thought to be a non-selective COX inhibitor, but it is now known to be 5-50 times more selective for COX-2 than COX-1. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults and over 18 years:\n\nEtodolac 300 mg capsule: 600 mg daily in 1-2 divided doses\nEtodolac 600 mg ER tablet: Once daily\n\r\nPediatric: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors. When Etodolac is administered with Aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free Etodolac is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of Etodolac and Aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.",
    "Contraindications": "Etodolac is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Etodolac. Etodolac should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria or other allergic type reactions after taking Aspirin or other NSAIDs.",
    "Side Effects": "The common side effects of Etodolac involve the gastrointestinal system. It can cause abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, heartburn, nausea, Gl ulcers, vomiting. Other events including abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, edema, elevated liver enzymes, headaches, increased bleeding time, pruritis, rashes, tinnitus etc.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Etodolac is excreted in human milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Etodolac should be given with caution in patients with severe hepatic reactions, pre existing asthma, fluid retention, hypertension or heart failure. If clinical sings and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash etc.), it should be discontinued.",

    "Pharmacology": "Pharmacodynamics: Pharmacotherapeutic classification: podophyllotoxin derivatives. Etoposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin used in the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases. Podophyllotoxins inhibit mitosis by blocking microtubular assembly. Etoposide inhibits cell cycle progression at a premitotic phase (late S and G2). It does not interfere with the synthesis of nucleic acids.Pharmacokinetics: On intravenous administration, the disposition of etoposide is best described as a biphasic process with a distribution half-life of about 1.5 hours and terminal elimination half-life ranging from 4 to 11 hours. Total body clearance values range from 33 to 48 ml/min or 16 to 36 ml/min/m 2 and, like the terminal elimination half-life, are independent of dose over a range 100-600 mg/m2. Over the same dose range, the areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves (AUC) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values increase linearly with dose. Etoposide does not accumulate in the plasma following daily administration of 100 mg/m 2 for 4 to 5 days.The mean volumes of distribution at steady state fall in the range of 18 to 29 liters or 7 to 17 L/m2",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Small cell lung cancer: The dose in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic drugs ranges from 35 mg/m2/day for 4 days to 50 mg/m2/day for 5 days. Or, as directed by the registered physicians.In patients with impaired renal function: The initial dose modification should be considered based on measured creatinine clearance: >50 mL/min: 100% of dose; 15-50 mL/min: 75% of dose. Subsequent Etoposide dosing should be based on patient tolerance and clinical effect. Data are not available in patients with creatinine clearances <15 ml/min and further dose reduction should be considered in these patients.",
    "Interaction": "High-dose cyclosporine a resulting in concentrations above 2000 ng/ml administered with oral Etoposide has led to an 80% increase in Etoposide exposure with a 38% decrease in total body clearance of etoposide compared to Etoposide alone. Laboratory Tests: Periodic complete blood counts should be done during the course of Etoposide treatment. They should be performed prior to each cycle of therapy and at appropriate intervals during and after therapy. At least one determination should be done prior to each dose of Etoposide.",
    "Contraindications": "Etoposide is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity to Etoposide or any component of the formulation.",
    "Side Effects": "The following data on adverse reactions are based on both oral and intravenous administration of Etoposide as a single agent, using several different dose schedules for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. Hematologic Toxicity: Myelosuppression is dose related and dose limiting, with granulocyte nadirs occurring 7 to 14 days after drug administration and platelet nadirs occurring 9 to 16 days after drug administration. Bone marrow recovery is usually complete by day 20, and no cumulative toxicity has been reported. Fever and infection have also been reported in patients with neutropenia. Death associated with myelosuppression has been reported. The occurrence of acute leukemia with or without a preleukemic phase has been reported rarely in patients treated with Etoposide in association with other antineoplastic agents.Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Nausea and vomiting are the major gastrointestinal toxicities. The severity of such nausea and vomiting is generally mild to moderate with treatment discontinuation required in 1% of patients. Nausea and vomiting can usually be controlled with standard antiemetic therapy. Mild to severe mucositis/ esophagitis may occur. Gastrointestinal toxicities are slightly more frequent after oral administration than after intravenous infusion. Hypotension: Transient hypotension following rapid intravenous administration has been reported in 1% to 2% of patients. It has not been associated with cardiac toxicity or electrocardiographic changes. No delayed hypotension has been noted. To prevent this rare occurrence, it is recommended that Etoposide be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a 30- to 60-minute period. If hypotension occurs, it usually responds to cessation of the infusion and administration of fluids or other supportive therapy as appropriate. When restarting the infusion, a slower administration rate should be used. Allergic Reactions: Anaphylactic-like reactions characterized by chills, fever, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and/or hypotension have been reported to occur in 0.7% to 2% of patients receiving intravenous Etoposide and in less than 1% of the patients treated with the oral capsules. These reactions have usually responded promptly to the cessation of the infusion and administration of pressor agents, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or volume expanders as appropriate; however, the reactions can be fatal. Hypertension and/or flushing have also been reported. Blood pressure usually normalizes within a few hours after cessation of the infusion. Anaphylactic like reactions have occurred during the initial infusion of Etoposide. Facial/tongue swelling, coughing, diaphoresis, cyanosis, tightness in throat, laryngospasm, back pain, and/or loss of consciousness have sometimes occurred in association with the above reactions. In addition, an apparent hypersensitivity-associated apnea has been reported rarely. Rash, urticaria, and/or pruritus have infrequently been reported at recommended doses. At investigational doses, a generalized pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, consistent with perivasculitis, has been reported. Alopecia: Reversible alopecia, sometimes progressing to total baldness, was observed in up to 66% of patients. Other Toxicities: The following adverse reactions have been infrequently reported: abdominal pain, aftertaste, constipation, dysphagia, asthenia, fatigue, malaise, somnolence, transient cortical blindness,optic neuritis, interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis, fever, seizure (occasionally associated with allergic reactions), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, pigmentation, and a single report of radiation recall dermatitis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category D. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant woman Etoposide has been reported to be found in human milk. Patient recieves Etoposide should not be breast feed.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Patients being treated with Etoposide must be frequently observed for myelosuppression both during and after therapy. Myelosuppression resulting in death has been reported. Dose limiting bone marrow suppression is the most significant toxicity associated with Etoposide therapy. Therefore, the following studies should be obtained at the start of therapy and prior to each subsequent cycle of Etoposide: platelet count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and differential. The occurrence of a platelet count below 50,000/mm3 or an absolute neutrophil count below 500/mm3 is an indication to withhold further therapy until the blood counts have sufficiently recovered. Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of an anaphylactic reaction manifested by chills, fever, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and hypotension. Higher rates of anaphylactic- like reactions have been reported in children who received infusions at concentrations higher than those recommended. The role that concentration of infusion (or rate of infusion) plays in the development of anaphylactic-like reactions is uncertain. Treatment is symptomatic. The infusion should be terminated immediately, followed by the administration of presser agents, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or volume expanders at the discretion of the physician. For parenteral administration, Etoposide should be given only by slow intravenous infusion (usually over a 30 to 60 minute period) since hypotension has been reported as a possible side effect of rapid intravenous injection In all instances where the use of Etoposide is considered for chemotherapy, the physician must evaluate the need and usefulness of the drug against the risk of adverse reactions. Most such adverse reactions are reversible if detected early. If severe reactions occur, the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken according to the clinical judgment of the physician. Reinstitution of Etoposide therapy should be carried out with caution, and with adequate consideration of the further need for the drug and alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity. Patients with low serum albumin may be at an increased risk for Etoposide associated toxicities.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Etoricoxib is a potent, orally active cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor within, and significantly above, the clinical dose range. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and adolescent over 16 years: \n\nOsteoarthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg once daily. In some patients with insufficient relief from symptoms, an increased dose of 60 mg once daily may increase efficacy.\nRheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\nAnkylosing spondylitis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\nAcute gouty arthritis: The recommended dose is 120 mg once daily. In clinical trials for acute gouty arthritis, Etoricoxib was given for 8 days.\nPostoperative dental surgery pain: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily, limited to a maximum of 3 days.\n\r\nSome patients may require additional postoperative analgesia. As the cardiovascular risks of Etoricoxib may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically, especially in patients with osteoarthritis.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.",

    "Indications": "Febuxostat tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Febuxostat tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Febuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.Hepatic impairment:\u00a0No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established",
    "Interaction": "Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Febuxostat on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Febuxostat with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds. Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Febuxostat metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Febuxostat. Febuxostat can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Febuxostat or naproxen being necessary. Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Febuxostat. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Febuxostat. Colchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Febuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Febuxostat. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Febuxostat . Antacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Febuxostat\u00a0 (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Febuxostat\u00a0 may be taken without regard to antacid use.",
    "Contraindications": "Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.",
    "Side Effects": "The most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Febuxostat have observed.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Gout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.Cardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with febuxostat than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.Liver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in febuxostat -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.",

    "Pharmacology": "Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic. Fentanyl interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor but also binds to kappa and delta-type opioid receptors. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, Fentanyl exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Fentanyl may increase the patient's tolerance for pain and decrease the perception of suffering, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Fentanyl depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.",

    "Interaction": "Co-administration of different antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, CNS depressant drugs like ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazadone may enhance or prolong the effects of Fentanyl. The concomitant use of amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil with Fentanyl may also result in an increase in Fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.",
    "Contraindications": "Fentanyl is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain. This product must not be used in opioid non-tolerant patients. Fentanyl is contraindicated in patients with known intolerance or hypersensitivity to any of its components or the drug Fentanyl.",
    "Side Effects": "As with other narcotic analgesics, the most common serious adverse reactions reported to occur with Fentanyl are respiratory depression, apnoea, muscular rigidity, myoclonic movements, and bradycardia. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur with intravenous administration if a dose is given too rapidly and it rarely occurs with intramuscular administration.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Fentanyl should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Fentanyl is excreted in human milk; therefore Fentanyl should not be used in nursing women because of the possibility of sedation and/or respiratory depression in their infants.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). Patients taking Fentanyl should be warned of these dangers and should be counseled accordingly. The use of concomitant CNS active drugs requires special patient care and observation.Chronic pulmonary disease: Fentanyl should be titrated with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression.\u00a0Head injuries and increased intracranial pressure: Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted.Cardiac disease: Intravenous Fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, Fentanyl should be used with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias.Hepatic or renal disease: Fentanyl should be used with caution because of the hepatic metabolism and renal excretion of Fentanyl.",

Iron salts should only be given for the treatment and as prophylaxis of Iron deficiency anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemias are most often the result of chronic haemorrhage, nutritional deficiency, pregnancy or parasite infestation or malabsorption of iron. A deficiency of Folic acid typically during pregnancy has long been known to cause a megaloblastic anaemia. The vitamin is not storable in the body and the combination of fetal demand during pregnancy and malnutrition can lead to a deficiency, hence anaemia. It has been observed that the rapid production of red blood cells following treatment with iron may deplete body folate if there is inadequate intake; combination of folic acid and ferrous fumerate avoids the complication. Iron and Folic acid are absorbed in the proximal small intestine particularly the duodenum. Ferrous Fumerate & Folic acid supplements replenish iron deficiency. Thereby arresting the anaemia process.

Fexofenadine improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

    "Interaction": "Fexofenadine does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to fexofenadine hydrochloride caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.",

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus",

Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fexofenadine has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Filgotinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and reversible inhibitor of the JAK family. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane. JAK1 is important in mediating inflammatory cytokine signals, JAK2 in mediating myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis and JAK3 plays critical roles in immune homeostasis and lymphopoiesis. Within the signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Filgotinib modulates these signalling pathways by preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. In biochemical assays, filgotinib preferentially inhibited the activity of JAK1 and showed >5-fold higher potency of filgotinib for JAK1 over JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Rheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose of Filgotinib is 200 mg tablet once a day.Ulcerative colitis: The recommended dose of Filgotinib is 200 mg once daily. Patients who have not shown any therapeutic benefit after 22 weeks of treatment should discontinue Filgotinibib. In adults at higher risk of venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events and malignancy, the recommended dose for maintenance treatment is 100 mg once daily.

    "name": "Finerenone",
    "generic_id": "2055",
    "Indications": "Finerenone is indicated to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D).",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Finerenone is a nonsteroidal, selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is activated by aldosterone and cortisol and regulates gene transcription. Finerenone blocks MR mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, and blood vessels) tissues. MR overactivation is thought to contribute to fibrosis and inflammation. Finerenone has a high potency and selectivity for the MR and has no relevant affinity for androgen, progesterone, estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors. In patients treated with Finerenone, the mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 3 mmHg and the mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 1-2 mmHg at month 1, remaining stable thereafter. At a dose 4 times the maximum approved recommended dose, Finerenone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. Finerenone is completely absorbed after oral administration but undergoes metabolism resulting in absolute bioavailability of 44%. Finerenone Cmax was achieved between 0.5 and 1.25 hours after dosing.Finerenone exposure increased proportionally over a dose range of 1.25 to 80 mg (0.06 to 4 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). Steady state of finerenone was achieved after 2 days of dosing. The estimated steady-state geometric mean Cmax, md was 160 \u03bcg/L and steady-state geometric mean AUCt,md was 686 \u03bcg.h/L following administration of finerenone 20 mg to patients.Absorption:\u00a0Finerenone is completely absorbed after oral administration but undergoes metabolism resulting in absolute bioavailability of 44%. Finerenone Cmax was achieved between 0.5 and 1.25 hours after dosing. Effect of Food There was no clinically significant effect on finerenone AUC following administration with high fat, high calorie food.Distribution:\u00a0The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) of finerenone is 52.6 L. Plasma protein binding of finerenone is 92%, primarily to serum albumin, in vitro.Elimination:\u00a0The terminal half-life of finerenone is about 2 to 3 hours, and the systemic blood clearance is about 25 L/h.Metabolism:\u00a0Finerenone is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 (90%) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8 (10%) to inactive metabolites. Excretion About 80% of the administered dose is excreted in urine",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dosage: 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serum potassium thresholds. Increase dosage after 4 weeks to the target dose of 20 mg once daily, based on eGFR and serum potassium thresholds. Tablets may be taken with or without food.Recommended Dosage-\n\neGFR \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m2: starting dose 20 mg once daily\neGFR \u226525 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2: starting dose 10 mg once daily\neGFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m2: not recommended\n\r\nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Finerenone may be crushed and mixed with water or soft foods.Monitoring and Dose Adjustment:\u00a0The target daily dose of Finerenone is 20 mg. Measure serum potassium 4 weeks after initiating treatment and adjust dose (see Table 2); if serum potassium levels are > 4.8 to 5.0 mEq/L, initiation of Finerenone treatment may be considered with additional serum potassium monitoring within the first 4 weeks based on clinical judgment and serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and throughout treatment and adjust the dose as needed.Missed doses:\u00a0Direct a patient to take a missed dose as soon as possible after it is noticed, but only on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as prescribed.",
    "Interaction": "Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Finerenone is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases finerenone exposure, which may increase the risk of Finerenone adverse reactions. Concomitant use of Finerenone with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. Avoid concomitant intake of grapefruit or grapefruit juice.Moderate and Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Finerenone is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use with a moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitor increases finerenone exposure, which may increase the risk of Finerenone adverse reactions. Monitor serum potassium during drug initiation or dosage adjustment of either Finerenone or the moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, and adjust Finerenone dosage as appropriate.Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Finerenone is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of Finerenone with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases finerenone exposure, which may reduce the efficacy of Finerenone. Avoid concomitant use of Finerenone with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors & patients with adrenal insufficiency.",
    "Side Effects": "Adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 1% of patients on Finerenone and more frequently than placebo are hyperkalemia, hypotension, and hyponatremia.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no available data on Kerendia use in pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal studies have shown developmental toxicity at exposures about 4 times those expected in humans. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.There are no data on the presence of finerenone or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. In a pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats, increased pup mortality and lower pup weight were observed at about 4 times the AUC unbound expected in humans. These findings suggest that finerenone is present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the potential risk to breastfed infants from exposure to Finerenone, avoid breastfeeding during treatment and for 1 day after treatment.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Finerenone can cause hyperkalemia. The risk for developing hyperkalemia increases with decreasing kidney function and is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment with Finerenone and dose accordingly. Do not initiate Finerenone if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L. Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Finerenone and adjust dose accordingly. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium.",

    "Pharmacology": "Flucloxacillin is active against Gram-positive organisms including penicillinase producing strains. It has little activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the \u03b2- lactam ring.",

    "Interaction": "In an interaction study, fuconazole increased the prothombin time after warfarin administration in healthy males. Though the magnitude of change was small (12%) careful monitoring of prothombin time in patients receiving coumarin type anticoagulants is recommended.Fluconazole has been shown to prolong the serum half-life of concomitantly administed oral sulphonyl ureas (chlorpropamide, gilbenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide) in healthy volunteers. Fluconazole and oral sulphonylureas may be co-administered to diabetic patients, but the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode should be borne in mind.In a kinetic interaction study, co-administration of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fuconazole increased plasma concentrations of fuconazole by 40%. An efect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fuconazole dose regimen in subjects recieving concomitant diureties, although the prescribers should bear it in mind.Concomitant administration of fuconazole and phenytoin may increase the level of phenytoin to a clinically signifcant degree. Administration of fuconazole and rifampicin has resulted in a 25% decrease in the AUC and 20% shorter half-life of fuconazole. Patients recieving concomitant rifampicin, an increase in the fuconazole dose should be considered.Two kinetic studies with combined oral contraceptive have been performed using muitiple dose of fuconazole. There were no relevant efects on either hormone level in the 50 mg fuconazole study, while at 200 mg daily the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 4% respectively. Thus multipule dose use of fuconazole at these dose is unlikely to have an efect on the efcacy of the combined oral contraceptives. Fluconazole 50 mg daily does not afect endogenous steroid levels in females. 200-400 mg daily has no clinically singnifcant efect on endogenous steroid levels or on ACTH stimulated response in healthy male volunteers.A kinetic study in renal transplant patients found fuconazole 200 mg daily to slowly increase cyclosporin concentrations. However, in another multiple dose study with 100 mg daily, fuconazole did not afect cyclosporin levels in patients with bone marrow transplants. Cyclosporin plasma concentration monitoring in patients receiving fuconazole is recommended.Interaction studies have shown that when oral fuconazole is co-administered with food. cemetidine, antacids or following total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, no clinically signifcant impairment of fuconazole absorption occurs.In placebo-controlled interaction study, the administration of fuconazole 200mg for 14 days resulted in an 18% decrease, in the mean plasma clearance of theophyline, Patients who are receiving dose of theophyline or who are otherwise at increased risk for theophyline toxicity should be observed for sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity while receiving fuconazole, and the therapy modifed appropriately if sign of toxicity develop.Physicians should be aware that drug-drug interaction studies with other medications have not been conducted, but that such interactions may occur.",

The commonest side-efects associated Fluconazole are symptoms associated with the gastrointestinal tract; these include nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and fatulence. Other adverse events such as rash are rarely encountered (Incidence less than 1%). In rare cases, as with other azoles, anaphylaxis has been reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Fluconazole adverse fetal efects have been seen in animals only at dose levels associated with maternal toxicity. These levels are many times in excess of those recommended for therapeutic use. There has been little use during human pregnancy. Accordingly, fuconazole should not be used in pregnancy or in women of child bearing potential unless adequate contraception is employed.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "in some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, abnormalities of hepatic, renal, haematological and other biochemical function tests have been observed during treatment with fuconazole, but the clinical signifcance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs.Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop.Use during lactation: Fluconazole is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended.Driving/Use of machinery: Experience with fuconazole indicates that therapy a unlikely to impair a patient's ability to drive or use machinery.",

The safety and effectiveness of Fludarabine Phosphate in previously untreated or non-refractory\u00a0patients with CLL have not been established.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite appears to act by inhibiting\u00a0DNA polymerase\u00a0alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis leading to cell death. The mechanism of action of this\u00a0antimetabolite\u00a0is not completely characterized and may be multi-faceted.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Fludarabine injection: This should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic therapy. The recommended dose is 25 mg Fludarabinebine phosphate/m\u00b2 body surface given daily for 5 consecutive days every 28 days by the intravenous route. Each vial is to be made up in 2 ml water for injection. Each ml of the resulting solution for injection/infusion will contain 25 mg Fludarabinebine phosphate. The required dose (calculated on the basis of the patient's body surface) is drawn up into a syringe. For intravenous bolus injection, this dose is further diluted into 10 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride. Alternatively, for infusion, the required dose drawn up in a syringe may be diluted into 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride and infused over approximately 30 minutes. The duration of treatment depends on the treatment success and the tolerability of the drug. In CLL patients, Fludarabine should be administered up to the achievement of best response (complete or partial remission, usually 6 cycles) and then the drug should be discontinued. In patients with Lg-NHL, treatment with Fludarabine is recommended up to the achievement of best response (complete or partial remission). Two cycles of consolidation should be considered after best response has been reached. In clinical trials with Lg-NHL, the majority of patients underwent not more than 8 cycles.Fludarabine tablet: The usual starting dose of Fludarabine tablets is 40 mg/m2 of Fludarabinebine phosphate administered once daily for five consecutive days every 28 days. The duration of treatment depends on the treatment success and the tolerability of the drug. Fludarabine oral should be administered until the achievement of a maximal response (complete or partial remission, usually 6 cycles) and then the drug should be discontinued.",
    "Interaction": "In a clinical investigation, using Fludara in combination with pentostatin (deoxycoformycin) for the treatment of CLL, there was an unacceptably high incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity. Therefore, the use of Fludara in combination with pentostatin is not recommended. Dipyridamole and other inhibitors of adenosine uptake may reduce the therapeutic efficacy of Fludara. Clinical studies and in vitro experiments showed that using Fludara in combination with cytarabine may increase the intracellular concentration and intracellular exposure of Ara-CTP (active metabolite of cytarabine) in leukemic cells. Plasma concentrations of Ara-C and the elimination rate of Ara-C were not affected.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Not available",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Flumazenil is recommended for intravenous (IV) use only and should be administered by an anaesthesiologist or experienced physician.In anaesthesia: The recommended initial dose of Flumazenil is 0.2 mg administered IV over 15 seconds. If the desired degree of consciousness is not obtained within 60 seconds, a second dose of 0.1 mg can be injected; this may be repeated at 60-second intervals where necessary, up to a total dose of 1 mg. The usual dose is 0.3-0.6 mg, but individual requirements may vary considerably, depending on the dose and duration of effect of the benzodiazepine administered and patient characteristics.In intensive care and in the management of unconsciousness of unknown origin: The recommended initial dose of Flumazenil is 0.3 mg IV. If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained within 60 seconds, Flumazenil may be injected repeatedly until the patient awakes or up to a total dose of 2 mg. If drowsiness recurs, Flumazenil may be administered as one or more bolus IV doses as above, or as an IV infusion of 0.1-0.4 mg per hour. The rate of infusion should be individually adjusted to the desired level of arousal. If a significant improvement in consciousness or respiratory function is not obtained after repeated doses of Flumazenil, a non-benzodiazepine aetiology must be assumed. In the intensive care unit, in patients treated with high doses of benzodiazepines and/or for long periods of time, the individually titrated injections of Flumazenil, slowly administered, should not produce withdrawal syndromes. If unexpected symptoms occur, diazepam or midazolam could be carefully titrated intravenously according to patient response.Children >1 year-of-age: For the reversal of conscious sedation induced with benzodiazepines in children above one year-of- age, the recommended initial dose is 0.01 mg/kg (up to 0.2 mg) administered IV over 15 seconds. If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting an additional 45 seconds, further injections of 0.01 mg/kg (up to 0.2 mg) can be administered and repeated at 60-second intervals where necessary (up to a maximum of four additional times) to a maximum total dose of 0.05 mg/kg or 1 mg, whichever is lower. The dose should be individualised based on patient response. No data are available on the safety and efficacy of repeated administration of Flumazenil to children for re-sedation.",
    "Interaction": "Interaction with other medicines and other forms of interaction: Flumazenil blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines by competitive interaction at the receptor level. The effects of non-benzodiazepine agonists at benzodiazepine receptors, such as zopiclone, triazolopyridazines and others, are also blocked by Flumazenil. The pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepine agonists are unaltered in the presence of Anexate and vice versa. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between ethanol and flumazenil.",
    "Contraindications": "Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the medicine. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have been given a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g. control of intracranial pressure or status epilepticus).",
    "Side Effects": "Flumazenil is well tolerated in adults and children. In adults, Flumazenil is well tolerated even at doses exceeding those recommended. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed. Complaints such as feelings of anxiety, palpitations and fear have been infrequently observed after rapid injection of Flumazenil. These adverse effects usually do not necessitate special treatment. Seizures have been reported in patients known to suffer from epilepsy or severe hepatic impairment, particularly after long-term treatment with benzodiazepines or in cases of mixed- substance overdose. In cases of mixed-substance overdose, particularly with cyclic antidepressants, toxic effects (such as convulsions and cardiac dysrhythmias) may emerge with the reversal of benzodiazepine effects by Flumazenil. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following rapid injection of Flumazenil in patients with long-term exposure to benzodiazepines ending at any time within the weeks preceding Flumazenil administration. Flumazenil has been reported to provoke panic attacks in patients with a history of panic disorders.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Although in-vitro and animal studies using high doses of Flumazenil have not shown evidence of mutagenicity, teratogenicity or impairment of fertility, the safety of Flumazenil in human pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, the benefits of medication during pregnancy should be weighed against possible risks to the foetus. Parenteral administration of Flumazenil in emergencies is not contraindicated during lactation. Animal studies using high doses of Flumazenil have not shown evidence of impairment of fertility.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Particular caution is necessary when using Flumazenil in cases of mixed-substance overdose since the toxic effects (such as convulsions and cardiac dysrhythmias) of other medicines taken in overdose (especially cyclic antidepressants) may emerge with the reversal of benzodiazepine effects by Flumazenil.The use of Flumazenil is not recommended in epileptic patients who have been receiving benzodiazepine treatment for a prolonged period. Although Flumazenil exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect, its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a benzodiazepine agonist can give rise to convulsions in epileptic patients.Patients who have received Flumazenil for the reversal of benzodiazepine effects should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression or other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period based on the dose and duration of effect of the benzodiazepine employed. As patients with underlying hepatic impairment may experience delayed benzodiazepine effects, an extended observation period may be required.When Flumazenil is used with neuromuscular-blocking agents, it should not be injected until the effects of neuromuscular blockade have been fully reversed.Flumazenil should be used with caution in patients with head injury as it may be capable of precipitating convulsions or altering cerebral blood flow in patients receiving benzodiazepines.Rapid injection of Flumazenil should be avoided in patients with high dose and/or long-term exposure to benzodiazepines ending at any time within the weeks preceding Flumazenil administration as it may produce withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, anxiety, emotional lability as well as mild confusion and sensory distortions.Flumazenil is not recommended either as a treatment for benzodiazepine dependence or for the management of protracted benzodiazepine abstinence syndromes.Flumazenil should be used with caution for the reversal of conscious sedation in children below the age of one year, for the management of overdose in children, for resuscitation of the newborn and for reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines used for induction of general anaesthesia in children, as experience is limited.",

Patients should be cautioned against driving motor vehicles or performing other potentially hazardous tasks where a loss of mental alertness may lead to accidents. Flunarizine is not suited for aborting a migraine attack. The possible occurrence of an attack is therefore no reason to increase the dose of Flunarizine. This treatment may give rise to extrapyramidal and depressive symptoms and reveal Parkinsonism, especially in predisposed patients such as the elderly. Flunarizine should therefore be used with caution in such patients.",

This\u00a0 can be used following removal of something from your eye, as well as before and after surgery, where there is a possibility of infection with susceptible organisms.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Their primary target is the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes.Like other aminoglycoside antibiotic drugs, neomycin inhibits bacterial ribosomes by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and disrupting the translational machinery of bacterial protein synthesis. Bacterial translation is normally initiated by the mRNA binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and subsequent binding with 50S subunit for elongation.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Fluorouracil is inactive as such in mammalian cells but is converted into the active 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) by a variety of different metabolic pathways. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus of DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 and S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell cycle.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Intravenous 5-fluorouracil can be delivered by rapid intravenous bolus injection or slow infusion. The vial contents can rapidly be injected directly into a peripheral vein, the commonest schedules being: 12-13.5 mg/Kg (500 mg/m2) daily for 5 days repeated at 4-weekly intervals. Slow intravenous infusion requires the drug, to be diluted in 500 ml of dextrose 5% solution, then infused over 2-3 hr on 5 successive days.For palliative management of cancer: Initial Dose: 12 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days. Maximum Dose: 800 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 6 mg/kg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7, 9, or 11). Discontinue at the end of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity.Poor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state: Initial Dose: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Maximum Dose: 400 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 3 mg/kg may be administered on days 5, 7, and 9 (No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end of day 9, even with no apparent toxicity.Maintenance therapy: In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules:\n\nRepeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course, or\nWhen the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Maximum Dose: 1g/week .The reaction by the patient to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nUsual adult dose for cervical cancer: In combination with cisplatin 1 gm/m2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every 21 days.Usual pediatric dose for malignant disease: The manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines.Intra-arterial infusion: Fluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5% Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump.Combination with radiation: Usual adult daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.Combination with other anticancer drugs: Fluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of breast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant neoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of breast cancer. A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily is given in combination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to twice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.",
    "Interaction": "Pre-treatment with cimetidine for 4 weeks led to increased plasma concentrations of fluorouracil following intravenous and oral administration in 6 patients. The effect was probably due to a combination of hepatic enzyme inhibition and reduced hepatic blood flow.",
    "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients that are severely debilitated or in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It should also be avoided in patients that do not have malignant illnesses.",
    "Side Effects": "Potentially life-threatening effects: Severe effects from 5-fluorouracil are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.Cardiac effects: Occasional case reports associating 5-fluorouracil therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.Hematological effects: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-fluorouracil on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-fluorouracil.Neurological effects: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-fluorouracil. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "5-fluorouracil is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3).

    "Pharmacology": "Fluoxetine has been shown to selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at the presynaptic neuronal membrane which causes increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS. This result in numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Fluoxetine appears to have no effect on the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and does not exhibit anticholinergic, antihistaminic or \u03b11 adrenergic blocking activity at usual therapeutic doses.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Initial treatment: Recent studies suggest that 20 mg/day of Fluoxetine may be sufficient to obtain satisfactory antidepressant response. Consequently, a dose of 20 mg/day administered in the morning is recommended as the initial dose.A dose increase may be considered after several weeks if no clinical improvement is observed. Dosage above 20 mg/day, should be administered on a bid schedule (i.e. morning and noon) and should not exceed a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. As with other antidepressants, the full antidepressant effect may be delayed until 4 weeks of treatment or longer. As with many other medications, a lower or less frequent dosage should be used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment. A lower or less frequent dosage should also be considered for patients, such as elderly, with concurrent disease or on multiple medication. A recommended maximum dose for elderly patients is 60 mg per day.Maintenance treatment: It is generally agreed among expert psychopharmacologists that acute episode of depression requires several months or longer sustained pharmacologic therapy. Fluoxetine is also used in dosage of 60 mg daily for the management of bulimia nervosa.Use in children: The use of Fluoxetine in children is not recommended as safety and efficacy have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "MAO inhibitors: Sometimes serious fatal reactions have been reported with concomitant use.\nAntidepressants: There have been greater than two fold increases of previously stable plasma levels of other antidepressants.\nLithium: There have been reports of increased or decreased lithium levels when used concomitantly with Fluoxetine.\nAntipsychotics: Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol and clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant Fluoxetine.\nAnticonvulsants: Patients on stable dose of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment.\nCNS active drugs: Caution is advised if concomitant administration of Fluoxetine is required.",
    "Contraindications": "Fluoxetine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to it.Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: There have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs and changes of mental status that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) in patients receiving Fluoxetine in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and in patients who have recently discontinued Fluoxetine and are then started on MAOIs. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Therefore, Fluoxetine should not be used in combination with MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with MAOI. Since Fluoxetine and its major metabolites have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping Fluoxetine and before starting MAOI.",
    "Side Effects": "Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, dry mouth, and diarrhoea.Neurological: Anxiety, nervousness, insomnia/ drowsiness and fatigue.Others: Excessive sweating, pruritus, skin rashes associated with liver, kidney and lung involvement. It has therefore been advised that Fluoxetine therapy should be discontinued in any patient who develops a skin rash.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "In animal studies, no teratogenicity or harmful effect was found. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human responses, Fluoxetine should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed.\u00a0As Fluoxetine is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluoxetine is administered to nursing women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "As Fluoxetine undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion, it should be used with caution and in reduced doses in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. Because of its epileptogenic effect, it should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy or a history of such disorders. Fluoxetine may alter glycaemic control and therefore caution is also warranted in diabetic subjects. Depressed patients with suicidal tendencies should be carefully supervised during treatment. Fluoxetine is not usually considered a suitable form of therapy for the depressive component of bipolar (manic depressive) illness as mania may be precipitated.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Flupentixol Dihydrochloride is a low dose neuroleptic of the thioxanthene group. In low doses (up to 3 mg/day)flupentixol has an anxiolytic, antidepressive and mood stabilizing effect and certain, activating properties. It acts mainly through a blockage of central monoamine receptors, especially in the dopaminergic system.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult: Standard initial dosage is 1 mg as a single morning dose. After one week the dose may be increased to 2 mg if there is inadequate clinical response. Daily dosage of more than 2 mg should be in divided doses up to a maximum 3 mg. In view of the activating properties of flupentixol, it is advisable to give the last dose of the day no later than evening. Patients often respond to flupentixol within two or three days. If no effect has been observed within one week at maximum dosage the drug should be withdrawn.In psychosis: Standard initial dosage is 3 to 9 mg twice daily adjusted according to the response; maximum 18 mg daily.Elderly: Standard initial dosage is 0.5 mg as a single morning dose. After one week, if response is inadequate, dosage may be increased to 1 mg once a day. Caution should be exercised in further increasing the dosage but occasional patients may require up to a maximum of 2 mg a day which should be given in divided doses (1 mg at breakfast time and 1 mg at about evening).Children: It is not recommended in children.",
    "Interaction": "When given with other drugs that product postural hypotension dosage adjustments may be necessary. Phenothiazines have been reported to reduce the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and other adrenergic neuron blockers. Phenothiazines may potentiate the adverse effects of other antimuscarinics. Concomitant administration of metoclopramide may increase the risk of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal effects and antiarrhythmics which prolong the QT interval may increase the likelihood of ventricular arrhythmias.",

Flutamide Tablets in combination with LHRH agonists are also indicated prior to and during definitive external beam radiotherapy for patients with bulky locally advanced Stage B2 and Stage C prostatic carcinoma.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "In animal studies, flutamide demonstrates potent antiandrogenic effects. It exerts its antiandrogenic action by inhibiting androgen uptake and/or by inhibiting nuclear binding of androgen in target tissues or both. Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen-sensitive and responds to treatment that counteracts the effect of androgen and/or removes the source of androgen, e.g. castration.",

In combination with an LHRH agonist, either the two agents may be initiated simultaneously, or Flutamide tablet therapy may be started 24 hours prior to initiation of the LHRH agonist. In the management of bulky locally advanced Stage B 2 and Stage C prostatic carcinoma, the recommended dosage is one 250 mg tablet, three times a day at eight-hour intervals. Flutamide should be started simultaneously or 24 hours prior to initiation of the LHRH agonist. Administration of Flutamide should begin eight weeks prior to external beam radiation therapy and continue through the course of radiation therapy.",
    "Interaction": "Interactions between Flutamide Tablets and leuprolide have not occurred. In patients receiving long-term oral-anticoagulant therapy, increases in prothrombin time have been reported after flutamide monotherapy was initiated. Therefore close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when flutamide tablets are administered concomitantly. Cases of increased theophylline plasma concentrations have been reported in patients receiving concomitant theophylline and flutamide tablets. Theophylline is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, which is the primary enzyme responsible for the conversion of flutamide to its active agent 2-hydroxyflutamide.",

Photosensitivity reactions have been reported in five patients.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "No studies have been conducted in pregnant or lactating women. Therefore, the possibility that Flutamide may cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant woman, or may be present in the breast milk of lactating women must be considered.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Periodic liver function tests and sperm count determinations must be performed in patients on long-term treatment with flutamide. After long-term administration in rats, flutamide produced testicular interstitial cell adenomas and dose-related increases in mammary gland adenomas or carcinomas. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. It should be noted that few cases of malignant breast neoplasms have been reported in male patients receiving flutamide; causality has not been established. Since flutamide tends to elevate plasma testosterone and estradiol levels, fluid retention may occur. Accordingly, flutamide should be used with caution in those patients with cardiac disease.Hepatic Injury: Treatment with flutamide should not be initiated in patients with serum transaminase levels exceeding 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal. Since transaminase abnormalities, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy have been reported with the use of flutamide, periodic liver function tests must be performed in all patients. Appropriate laboratory testing should be done monthly for the first 4 months, and periodically thereafter and at the first symptom/sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark urine, persistent anorexia, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness or unexplained \"flu-like\" symptoms). If the patient has laboratory evidence of liver injury or jaundice, in the absence of biopsy-confirmed\u00a0liver metastases, flutamide therapy should be discontinued if the patient develops jaundice or if serum transaminase levels rise to 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal, even in clinically asymptomatic patients.

Sudden and progressive deterioration in asthma control is potentially life-threatening and consideration should be given to increasing corticosteroid dosage. In patients considered at risk, daily peak flow monitoring may be instituted. Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroid is regularly monitored. It is important, therefore, that the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.

    "generic_id": "1342",
    "Indications": "Fluticasone Propionate nebuliser suspension is indicated in-Adults and adolescents over 16 years of age: Prophylactic management in severe asthma (patients requiring high dose inhaled or oral corticosteroid therapy).Children and adolescents from 4 to 16 years of age: Treatment of mild to moderate acute exacerbations of asthma.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The precise mechanisms of glucocorticoid action in asthma are unknown. Inflammation is recognized as an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and mediator production or secretion (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in the asthmatic response. These anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.Though highly effective for the treatment of asthma, glucocorticoids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. However, improvement following inhaled administration of fluticasone propionate can occur within 24 hours of beginning treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When glucocorticoids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adults and adolescents over 16 years (prophylactic management in severe asthma): 0.5-2 mg twice daily. The recommended initial dose is 2 mg twice daily. The dosage should then be adjusted until control is achieved or reduced to the minimum effective dose according to the individual response.Children and adolescents 4 to 16 years of age (treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma): 1 mg twice daily.",
    "Interaction": "Clinically significant drug interactions mediated by Fluticasone Propionate are unlikely.",
    "Contraindications": "Fluticasone Propionate Nebuliser Suspension is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any component of the preparation.",
    "Side Effects": "Candidiasis of the mouth and throat and/or hoarseness is commonly reported. Patients may find it helpful to rinse out their mouth with water after inhalation. As with other inhalation therapy, paradoxical bronchospasm may occur rarely, with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. There have also been rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions manifesting as angioedema, bronchospasm and very rarely, anaphylactic reactions. Other adverse events that may occur rarely include depression of plasma cortisol in adult patients on higher doses, bone density reduction, growth retardation, cataract, glaucoma.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category B3. There is inadequate evidence of safety of Fluticasone Propionate in human pregnancy. However, as with other drugs the administration of Fluticasone Propionate during pregnancy should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus. The excretion of Fluticasone Propionate into human breast milk has not been investigated.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Fluticasone Propionate Nebuliser Suspension should not be used for the treatment of severe acute exacerbations of asthma in children and adolescents as efficacy in this situation has not been established. Patients receiving treatment with nebulised Fluticasone Propionate must be warned that if their clinical condition deteriorates, or if a dose fails to give the usual relief, they should not increase the dose or the frequency of administration, but should seek medical advice. Prolonged therapy with inhaled Fluticasone Propionate Nebuliser Suspension should be reduced gradually and not stopped abruptly, and this should be done under medical supervision.",

    "Indications": "Fluticasone Propionate is indicated for the relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive eczema/dermatitis.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Fluticasone propionate is a glucocorticoid with high topical anti-inflammatorypotency, but a low HPA-axis suppressive activity after dermal administration. It, therefore, has a therapeutic index which is greater than most of the commonly available steroids. Fluticasone propionate has a high degree of selectivity for the glucocorticoid receptor. In vitro studies show that fluticasone propionate has a strong affinity for, and agonist activity at, human glucocorticoid receptors. This receptor is believed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids. Fluticasone propionate has weak affinity forthe progesterone receptor, andvirtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors. The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half-life of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex. The half-life of the Fluticasone propionate glucocorticoid-receptor complex is approximately 10 hours.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Cream: Apply a thin layer of Fluticasone propionate cream to the affected skin areas once daily.Ointment: Apply a thin layer of Fluticasone propionate Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily.",
    "Interaction": "No information is available.",
    "Contraindications": "Fluticasone propionate is contraindicated in Rosacea, Acne vulgaris, Perioral dermatitis, Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g., Herpes simplex, chicken pox), Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients, Perianal and genital pruritus, etc. The use of Fluticasone propionate is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi or bacteria and dermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.",
    "Side Effects": "The fluticasone propionate preparations are usually well tolerated; local burning and pruritus have been reported. If signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Prolonged and intensive treatment with potent corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, hypertrichosis and hypopigmentation. Secondary infection, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved and allergic contact dermatitis have also been reported with corticosteroid use. Exacerbation of the signs and symptoms of the dermatoses have been reported with corticosteroid use. Prolonged use of large amounts of corticosteroids, or treatment of extensive areas, can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism. This effect is more likely to occur in infants and children, and if occlusive dressings are used. In infants, the napkin may act as an occlusive dressing.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Administration of fluticasone propionate during pregnancy should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. The excretion of fluticasone propionate into human breast milk has not been investigated. Plasma levels in patients following dermal application of fluticasone propionate at recommended doses are likely to be low. When fluticasone propionate is used in breastfeeding mothers, the therapeutic benefits must be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and baby.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Fluticasone propionate has a very low propensity for systemic absorption, nevertheless, prolonged application of high doses to large areas of the body surface, especially in infants and small children might lead to adrenal suppression. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atropic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating severe eczema. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of antimicrobial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressing, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.",

    "Contraindications": "this inhaler should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator is required. Patients should be advised to have their medicine to be used for relief in an acute asthma attack available at all times.The prophylactic use of this inhaler in exercise-induced asthma has not been studied. For such use, a separate rapid-acting bronchodilator should be considered. Patients should be reminded to take their this inhaler maintenance dose as prescribed, even when asymptomatic. Patients should not be initiated on this inhaler during an exacerbation, or if they have significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhaler. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation on this inhaler.This inhaler should not be used as the first treatment for asthma.This inhaler should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, quiescent tuberculosis or patients with fungal, viral or other infections of the airway. This inhaler should be used with caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis, phaeochromocytoma, diabetes mellitus, uncorrected hypokalaemia or patients predisposed to low levels of serum potassium, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, idiopathic subvalvular aortic stenosis, severe hypertension, aneurysm or other severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias or severe heart failure. Caution must be observed when treating patients with existing prolongation of the QTc interval. Formoterol itself may induce prolongation of the QTc interval.As for all \u00df2 agonists, additional blood sugar controls should be considered in diabetic patients. As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. This inhaler should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary.Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include Cushing\u2019s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). It is important, therefore, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained.",
    "Side Effects": "As with other inhalation therapy, paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. Since Flutide inhaler contains both Fluticasone Propionate and FormoterolFumarate, the same pattern of undesirable effects as reported for these substances may occur. In the unlikely event of a hypersensitivity reaction to Flutide inhaler, treatment should be initiated in accordance with standard treatment for any other hypersensitivity reaction, which may include the use of antihistamines and other treatment as required. Flutide inhaler may need to be discontinued immediately and an alternative asthma therapy may need to be initiated if necessary. Dysphonia and candidiasis may be relieved by gargling or rinsing the mouth with water or brushing the teeth after using the product. Symptomatic candidiasis can be treated with topical anti-fungal therapy whilst continuing the treatment with Flutide inhaler.",

It is a metabolite and active form of folic acid that is involved as a cofactor for 1-carbon transfer reactions in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidines of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective DNA synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Because of its ready conversion to other tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives, Folinate is a potent antidote for both hematopoietic and reticuloendothelia toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, (e.g. methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim). It is postulated that in some cancers, folinate enters and \"rescues\" normal cells from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in preference to tumour cells, because of a difference in membrane transport mechanisms; this principle is the basis of high-dose methotrexate therapy with \"Folinate rescue\".",

There are no fixed guidelines regarding the dose of methotrexate that triggers an automatic subsequent Folinic Acid administration, since tolerance to this folate antagonist depends on various factors. The dose of methotrexate varies, nevertheless folinate rescue is necessary when methotrexate is given at doses exceeding 500 mg/m2 and has to be considered with doses of 100 mg-500 mg/m2. Folinic Acid rescue treatment should commence approximately 24 hours after the beginning of methotrexate infusion. Dosage regimens vary depending upon the dose of methotrexate administered. In general, Folinic Acid should be administered at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses.The recommended dose of Folinic Acid to counteract hematologic toxicity from folic acid antagonists with less affinity for mammalian dihydrofolate reductase than methotrexate (i.e., trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) is substantially less and 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day has been recommended.Neutralising the immediate toxic effects of folic acid antagonists: If overdosage of methotrexate is suspected, the dose of Folinic Acid should be equal to or greater than the dose of methotrexate and should be administered within one hour of the methotrexate administration.Megaloblastic anaemia (folate deficiency): 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day.Use in children and adolescents: The safety and efficacy of folinic acid in children and adolescents have not beenestablished.",
    "Interaction": "Folinates given in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbitone, phenytoin and primidone and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible patients. Caution is required during concurrent administration of calcium folinate with fluoropyrimidine as this has been associated with seizures and syncope.",
    "Contraindications": "Folinic Acid is contraindicated to patients with known hypersensitivity to calcium folinate or any other components of this product. It is also contraindicated in pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemia where vitamin B12 is deficient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take calcium folinate tablets.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common side effects of Folinic Acid are mucositis, stomatitis, leukopenia and/or diarrhea, which may be dose-limiting.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies conducted in pregnant women. Folinic Acid should only be used in pregnant women if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcium folinate is administered to a nursing mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Folinic Acid should only be used with methotrexate or 5-FU under the direct supervision of a clinician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the treatment of inadvertent overdosage of a folic acid antagonist, folinate should be administered as soon as possible; if a period exceeding 4 hours intervenes, the treatment may not be effective. In general, Folinic Acid should not be given simultaneously with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to abort clinical toxicity as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified. Flowever, Folinic Acid given concurrently with folate antagonists, such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim does not inhibit their antibacterial activity. Measures to ensure the prompt excretion of methotrexate are important as part of Folinic Acid Rescue Therapy. These measures include:\n\nAlkalinisation of urine so that the urinary pH is greater than 7.0 before methotrexate infusion (to increase solubility of methotrexate and its metabolites).\nMaintenance of urine output of 1800-2000 cc/m2/24 hour by increased oral or intravenous fluids on days 2, 3 and 4 following methotrexate therapy.\nPlasma methotrexate concentration, BUN and creatinine should be measured on days 2, 3 and 4. These measures must be continued until the plasma methotrexate level is less than 10-7 molar.",

The presence of LH is less than 0.1% per 75 IU of FSH & Unidentified urinary proteins are less than 5% in Human FSH-HP. FSH consists of two non-covalently linked glycoproteins designated as the alfa and beta subunits. The alfa subunit has 92 amino acids of which two are modified by attachment of carbohydrates. The beta subunit has 111 amino acids of which two are modified by attachment of carbohydrates. FSH is a sterile, lyophilized powder intended for subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection after reconstitution with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Each vial of FSH contains 75 International Units (IU) of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) which is reconstituted with diluents. The in vivo biological activity of Urofollitropin (FSH) for injection, purified is determined by using reference standards calibrated against the First International Standard for follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH, Urofollitropin), Urinary, and Human for Bioassay, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) at its 46th meeting in 1995.

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category X. FSH must not be used during pregnancy and lactation.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The presence of uncontrolled non gonodalendocrinopathies (e.g. thyroid, adrenal or pituitary disorders) should be excluded\n\nIn pregnancies occurring after induction of ovulation with gonadotrophin preparations, there is an increased risk of multiple gestations (Multiple birth)\nThere has been no reports of hypersensitivity to FSH, but there remains the possibility of anaphylactic responses\nThe first injection of FSH should be performed under direct medical supervision\nSince infertile women undergoing assisted reproduction, and particularly IVF, often have tubal abnormalities the incidence of ectopic pregnancies might be increased. Early ultrasound confirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine is therefore important.\nRates of pregnancy loss in women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques are higher than in the normal population.\nUnwanted ovarian hyperstimulation in the treatment of female patients, ultrasonographic assessment of follicular development, and determination of oestradiol levels should be performed prior to treatment and at regular intervals during treatment. Apart from the development of a high number of follicles, oestradiol levels may rise very rapidly, e.g. more than a daily doubling for two or three consecutive days, and possibly reaching excessively high values. The diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation may be confirmed by ultrasound examination. If this unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation occurs (i.e. not as part of controlled\novarian hyperstimulation in medically assisted reproduction programs), the administration of FSH should be discontinued. In that case pregnancy should be avoided and HCG must be withheld, because it may induce, in addition to multiple ovulation, the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\nIn men, semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response",

The incidence of congenital malformations after some Assisted Reproductive Technology, specifically in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)], may be slightly higher than that after spontaneous conception. This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, maternal and paternal genetic background, sperm characteristics) and to a higher incidence of multi-fetal gestations after IVF or ICSI. There is no human data that the use of gonadotropins (including Follitropin Alfa alone or as part of IVF or ICSI cycles, increases the risk of congenital malformations.There are no data on the presence of Follitropin Alfa in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because the secretion of prolactin during lactation can result in inadequate response to ovarian stimulation, advise women not to breast feed during treatment with Follitropin Alfa.",

May cause systemic corticosteroid effects.\nOther adrenergic drugs may potentiate effect: Use with caution.\nDiuretics, xanthine derivatives or steroids may potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes. Use with caution.\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate effect of formoterol fumarate on cardiovascular system.\nBeta-blockers: Use with caution. May block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm.\nAnticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of this spray\u00a0with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.",
    "Contraindications": "This is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to budesonide, glycopyrrolate, formoterol, or any of the excipients.",
    "Side Effects": "Serious asthma-related events-hospitalizations, intubations, death, Candida albicans infection, increased risk of pneumonia, immunosuppression and risk of infections, hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, paradoxical bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, cardiovascular effects, reduction in bone mineral density, worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma and cataracts, worsening of urinary retention",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with this inhaler or with two of its individual components, Glycopyrrolate or Formoterol Fumarate, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. There are no available data on the effects of this inhaler on the breastfed child or on milk production. Budesonide, like other ICS, is present in human milk. There are no available data on the presence of Glycopyrrolate or Formoterol Fumarate in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for this inhaler and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from this inhaler or from the underlying maternal condition.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The safety and efficacy of this inhaler in patients with asthma have not been established. this inhaler is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. This inhaler has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of this inhaler in this setting is not appropriate. This inhaler should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. This inhaler has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist. When beginning treatment with this inhaler, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing this inhaler, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short acting beta 2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta 2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.The daily dosage of this inhaler should not be increased beyond the recommended dose. As with other inhaled drugs containing beta2-adrenergic agents, this inhaler should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.Patients using this inhaler should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.this inhaler contains budesonide, an ICS. Localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans have occurred in subjects treated with orally inhaled drug products containing budesonide. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with this inhaler continues.Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, have been reported following the inhaled administration of corticosteroids. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbations frequently overlap. Patients who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids.Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible.Effects of budesonide on the HPA axis are not observed with the therapeutic doses of budesonide in this inhaler. However, exceeding the recommended dosage or co-administration with a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor may result in HPA dysfunction.It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, appropriate therapy should be initiated as needed.Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of this inhaler with long-term ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur.As with other inhaled therapies, this inhaler can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with this inhaler, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; this inhaler should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted.Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of Budesonide, Glycopyrrolate or Formoterol Fumarate, the components of this inhaler. If signs suggesting allergic reactions occur, in particular, angioedema (including difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of tongue, lips, and face), urticaria, or skin rash, this inhaler should be stopped at once and alternative treatment should be considered.Formoterol fumarate, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and also cardiac arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles. If such effects occur, this inhaler may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the Twave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, this inhaler should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension",

Child 5 years and over: By intravenous infusion (at a rate of 1-2 mg/kg/minute), same dose and dosing frequency as oral Phenytoin therapy. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Disease: After IV Fosphenytoin administration to patients with renal and/or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, Fosphenytoin clearance to Phenytoin may be increased without a similar increase in Phenytoin clearance. This has the potential to increase the frequency and severity of adverse events. Elderly: Age does not have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of Fosphenytoin following Fosphenytoin administration. Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required.",
    "Interaction": "No drugs are known to interfere with the conversion of Fosphenytoin to Phenytoin.

Do not, therefore, make any adjustment in the recommended doses when substituting Fosphenytoin for Phenytoin Sodium or vice versa. Fosphenytoin Sodium should always be prescribed and dispensed in Phenytoin Sodium equivalent units (PE). The following warnings are based on experience with Fosphenytoin or Phenytoin. Status Epilepticus Dosing Regime: Do not administer Fosphenytoin at a rate greater than 150 mg PE/min. The dose of IV Fosphenytoin (15 to 20 mg PE/kg) that is used to treat status epilepticus is administered at a maximum rate of 150 mg PE/min. The typical Fosphenytoin infusion administered to a 50 kg patient would take between 5 and 7 minutes. If rapid Phenytoin loading is a primary goal, IV administration of Fosphenytoin is preferred. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus: Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. Cardiovascular Depression: Fosphenytoin should be used with caution in patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. Rash: Fosphenytoin should be discontinued if a skin rash appears. Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with Phenytoin. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, Fosphenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. Hemopoietic System: Hemopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of Phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. Alcohol Use: Acute alcohol intake may increase plasma Phenytoin concentrations while chronic alcohol use may decrease plasma concentrations.Phosphate Load: The phosphate load provided by Fosphenytoin (0.0037 mmol phosphate/mg PE Fosphenytoin) should be considered when treating patients who require phosphate restriction, such as those with severe renal impairment. General: Fosphenytoin is not indicated for the treatment of absence seizures. Phenytoin and other Hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced Phenytoin hypersensitivity.

In in vivo tumor studies, fulvestrant delayed the establishment of tumors from xenografts of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in nude mice. Fulvestrant inhibited the growth of established MCF-7 xenografts and of tamoxifen-resistant breast tumor xenografts.Fulvestrant showed no agonist-type effects in in vivo uterotrophic assays in immature or ovariectomized mice and rats. In in vivo studies in immature rats and ovariectomized monkeys, fulvestrant blocked the uterotrophic action of estradiol.

    "Pharmacology": "Furosemide is a monosulphonyl diuretic. It is an effective diuretic that retains its activity even in low glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Furosemide has a distinctive action on renal tubular function. It affects a peak diuresis far greater than that observed with other agents. Other features are (I) prompt onset of action (II) inhibition of sodium and chloride transport in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and (III) independence of their action from acid-base balance changes. Furosemide acts primarily to inhibit electrolyte reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Furosemide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and considerable proportions are bound to plasma proteins. It is rapidly excreted in the urine. With an hour after intravenous injection, its effect is evident in about 5 minutes and last for about 2 hours.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Furosemide 40 mg Tablet-Edema: \n\nAdults: The initial adult dose is 40 mg daily, reduced to 20 mg daily or 40mg on alternate days. In some patients daily doses of 80mg or higher (given in divided doses) may be required. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (eg, at 8 am and 2 pm). For resistant edema, 80-120 mg daily. In patients with clinically severe edematous states the dose of furosemide may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day. When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable.\nChildren: Neonate: 0.5-2 mg/kg every 12-24 hours (every 24 hours if postmenstrual age under 31 weeks).\nChild 1 month-12 years: 0.5-2 mg/kg 2-3 times daily (every 24 hours if postmenstrual age less than 31 weeks); higher doses may be required in resistant edema; max. 12 mg/kg daily, not to exceed 80 mg daily.\nChild 12-18 years:20-40 mg daily, increased in resistant edema to 80-120 mg daily.\nElderly: In the elderly furosemide is generally eliminated more slowly. Dosage should be titrated until the required response is achieved.\n\r\nHypertension:\n\nAdults: The usual initial dose of furosemide for hypertension is 80 mg, usually divided into 40 mg twice a day. Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If response is not satisfactory, add other antihypertensive agents.\nChildren: The usual dose is 1 - 3 mg/kg body weight daily up to a maximum dose of 40mg/day.\nElderly: In the elderly furosemide is generally eliminated more slowly. Dosage should be titrated until the required response is achieved.\n\nFurosemide 250 mg Tablet: For selected patients with advanced chronic renal failure, diuretic therapy may be started with Furosemide\u00a0orally. If conventional doses (80 to 160 mg orally) fail to produce an adequate diuresis, a single dose of 250 mg is given as a starting dose. If a satisfactory diuresis does not ensue within 4-6 hours, the initial dose may be doubled to 500 mg. The criterion of optimal dosage is a urinary output of at least 2.5 liters per day. A maximum daily dose of 1000 mg should not be exceeded.Furosemide Syrup: Furosemide Liquid has an exceptionally wide therapeutic range, the effect being proportional to the dosage. Furosemide Liquid is best given as a single dose either daily or on alternate days. The usual initial daily dose is 40 mg. This may require adjustment until the effective dose is achieved as a maintenance dose. In mild cases, 20 mg daily or 40 mg on alternate days may be sufficient, whereas in cases of resistant edema, daily doses of 80 mg and above may be used as one or two daily, or intermittently. Severe cases may require gradual titration of the furosemide dosage up to 600 mg daily. The recommended maximum daily dose of furosemide administration is 1,500 mg.Furosemide Injection-Edema: Adults: Doses of 20-50 mg intramuscularly or intravenously may be given initially. If larger doses are required, they should be given increasing by 20 mg increments and not given more often than every two hours. If doses greater than 50 mg are required it is recommended that they should be given by slow intravenous infusion. The recommended maximum daily dose of furosemide administration is 1,500 mg.By slow intravenous injection:\n\nNeonate: 0.5-1 mg/kg every 12-24 hours (every 24 hours if postmenstrual age under 31 weeks).\nChild 1 month-12 years: 0.5-1 mg/kg repeated every 8 hours as necessary;maximum 2 mg/kg (max. 40 mg) every 8 hours.\nChild 12-18 years: 20-40 mg repeated every 8 hours as necessary; higher doses may be required in resistant cases.\n\r\nBy continuous intravenous infusion:\n\nChild 1 month-18 years: 0.1-2 mg/kg/hour (following cardiac surgery, initially 100 micrograms/kg/hour, doubled every 2 hours until urine output exceeds 1 mL/kg/hour).\nElderly: In the elderly furosemide is generally eliminated more slowly. Dosage should be titrated until the required response is achieved.\n\r\nHypertension:\n\nAdults: Doses of 20 to 50 mg intramuscularly or intravenously may be given initially. If larger doses are required, they should be given increasing by 20 mg increments and not given more often than every two hours. If doses greater than 50 mg are required it is recommended that they should be given by slow intravenous infusion. The recommended maximum daily dose of furosemide administration is 1,500 mg. Children: Parenteral doses for children range from 0.5-1.5 mg/kg body weight daily up to a maximum total daily dose of 20 mg.\nElderly: In the elderly furosemide is generally eliminated more slowly. Dosage should be titrated until the required response is achieved.",
    "Interaction": "A marked fall in blood pressure may be seen when ACE inhibitors are added to furosemide therapy. Serum lithium levels may be increased when lithium is given concomitantly with furosemide.

    "Contraindications": "Furosemide is contraindicated in anuria, electrolyte deficiency and pre-comatose states associated with liver cirrhosis. Hypersensitivity to furosemide or sulphonamides.",
    "Side Effects": "As with other diuretics, electrolytes and water balance may be disturbed as a result of diuresis of prolonged therapy. Prolonged use can produce alkalosis. It may also cause uric acid retention and may rarely produce acute gout. Furosemide may provoke hyperglycemia and glycosuria.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category C. Furosemide should be cautiously used in cardiogenic shock complicated by pulmonary oedema and in the first trimester of pregnancy. Blood pressure and pulse during rapid diuresis should be monitored. Caution should be observed in patients liable to electrolyte deficiency. In case of nursing mother, furosemide may inhibit lactation or may pass into breast milk. In that case it should be used with caution.",

    "Indications": "Frusemide & Spironolactone combination is indicated in-\n\nEssential hypertension\nChronic congestive heart failure\nHepatic cirrhosis, with collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites)\nSwelling due to excess fluid retention (edema)\nHyperaldosteronism\nResistant edema associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Spironolactone (potassium sparing diuretic) and Furosemide (loop diuretic) have different but complementary mechanisms and sites of action. Therefore, when given together they produce additive or synergistic diuretic. The Furosemide component inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter in the ascending Loop of Henle and blocks the reabsorption of sodium, potassium and chloride ions; thereby increasing the quantity of sodium and the volume of water excreted in the urine. This characteristically induces potassium loss. The spironolactone component inhibits the reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium at the distal tubule by antagonising the action of aldosterone so that sodium excretion is greatly favoured and the excess loss of potassium, induced by the Furosemide, is reduced",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Furosemide 20 and spironolactone 50 mg: 1 to 4 tablets daily (20 to 80 mg of Furosemide and 50 to 200 mg of spironolactone) according to the patient\u2019s response.Furosemide 40 and spironolactone 50 mg: For previously stabilized patients requiring a higher dosage of spironolactone and Furosemide, This tablet can be used at a dose of one to two tablets daily (Furosemide 40 to 80 mg and spironolactone 50 to 100 mg).Use in children:\u00a0Spironolactone and Furosemide is not suitable for use in children. Spironolactone and Furosemide may both be excreted more slowly in the elderly.",
    "Interaction": "When taken together with ACE inhibitors or potassium salts there is an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Spironolactone increases the levels of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin in the blood and this may result in digitalis toxicity. Corticosteroids may cause hypokalemia if they are used with Spironolactone. The blood pressure lowering and diuretic effects of Furosemide may be reduced or abolished when used together with indomethacin and possibly other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Furosemide may increase the ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Simultaneous administration of sucralfate and Furosemide may reduce the natriuretic and anti-hypertensive effect of Furosemide.",
    "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in patients with anuria, acute renal insufficiency, rapidly deteriorating or severe impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min), hyperkalaemia, Addison's disease and in patients who are hypersensitive to Spironolactone, Furosemide or sulphonamides.",
    "Side Effects": "Spironolactone may give rise to headache and drowsiness and gastrointestinal distress, including cramp and diarrhoea. Ataxia, mental confusion, and skin rashes have been reported as side effect. Gynaecomastia is not uncommon and in rare cases breast enlargement may persist. Other endocrine disorders including hirsutism, deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities and impotence. Transient increase in blood-urea-nitrogen concentrations may occur and mild acidosis has been reported. Spironolactone may cause hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Excessive diuresis may result in dehydration and reduction in blood volume with circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism particularly in elderly patients. Serious depletion of potassium and magnesium may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Spironolactone and its metabolites may cross the placental barrier. The use of spironolactone in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against the possible hazards to the mother and fetus. Animal teratology studies indicate that Furosemide may cause fetal abnormalities. Therefore, Furosemide should only be used in women in child bearing age when appropriate contraceptive measures are taken or if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.Lactation: Metabolites of Spironolactone have been detected in breast milk. If use of Spironolactone is considered essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted. Furosemide is excreted in breast milk and breast-feeding should be discontinued if treatment is essential.",

As much as 2% of the amount of topically applied fusidic acid penetrates intact skin. The degree of penetration depends on factors such as the duration of exposure to fusidic acid and the condition of the skin. Fusidic acid is excreted mainly in the bile with little excreted in the urine. Dermal absorption and potency of any topical corticosteroid including betamethasone depends on the vehicle in which the steroid is delivered.

Gadodiamide provides contrast enhancement and facilitates visualisation of abnormal structures or lesions in various parts of the body including the CNS.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "This is a clear, colourless to slightly yellow aqueous solution containing Gadodiamide USP 287 mg/ml equivalent\u00a0 to 0.5 mmol/ml. For Magnetic resonance imaging, visualization of normal and pathological brain and spinal tissue depends, in part, on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity. Gadodiamide decreases both the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it is distributed. At clinical doses, the effect is primarily on the T1 relaxation time, and produces an increase in signal intensity.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "No special preparation of the patient is required. Gadodiamide should be drawn into the syringe immediately before use. The vial is intended for one patient only. Contrast medium not used in one examination must be discarded.Dosage for adults and children: The recommended dosage is 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (equivalent to 0.2 ml/kg body weight) up to 100 kg. Above 100 kg body weight 20 ml is usually sufficient to provide diagnostically adequate contrast. The required dose should be administered as a single intravenous injection. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the intravenous line may be flushed with 5 ml sodium chloride injection 0.9%.Adults only: When brain metastases are suspected, a dosage of 0.3 mmol/kg body weight (equivalent to 0.6 ml/ kg body weight) can be administered up to 100 kg. Above 100 kg body weight a total of 60 ml is usually sufficient. The dose of 0.3 mmol/kg body weight can be administered as a bolus intravenous injection. In patients with equivocal scans after administration of the 0.1 mmol/kg body weight injection, a second bolus injection of 0.2 mmol/kg body weight (equivalent to 0.4 ml/kg body weight) may be of additional diagnostic value when administered within 20 minutes of the first injection.",
    "Interaction": "Asymptomatic transitory increases in serum iron and bilirubin have been reported in patients receiving Gadodiamide. Gadodiamide should not be directly mixed with other drugs. A separate syringe and needle should be used.",

    "Side Effects": "Discomfort with a general sensation of warmth, coolness or a sensation of local pressure or pain at the injection site were commonly (>1% and <10%) observed in clinical studies. Dizziness, nausea, headache and a perverted sense of taste or smell were reported less frequently, but also in >1% of patients.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: The results of three in vitro and one in vivo short-term genotoxicity assays were negative. No long-term studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Gadodiamide. Gadodiamide had no effect on the fertility and general reproductive performance in rats or in teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses that did not cause maternal toxicity.Use in Pregnancy: Pregnancy category B3. No effects of Gadodiamide on reproductive performance were seen in rats at doses up to 1.0 mmol/kg. In rabbits, there is an increased incidence of litters with skeletal or visceral abnormalities at doses up to 0.5 and 1.0 mmol/kg. However, these effects are possibly attributable to maternal toxicity rather than a direct effect of the drug. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Gadodiamide in pregnant women. Gadodiamide should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.Use in Lactation: It is not known whether Gadodiamide is excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to administration and should not be recommenced until at least 24 hours after the administration of Gadodiamide.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The accepted safety considerations and procedures that are required for magnetic resonance imaging are applicable when Gadodiamide is used for contrast enhancement. Administration of contrast media should be performed by qualified personnel familiar with the procedure and an appropriate technique should be utilised. The possibility of a reaction, including serious, life-threatening, fatal, anaphylactoid or cardiovascular or other idiosyncratic reactions should always be considered, especially in those patients with known clinical hypersensitivity or a history of asthma or other allergic respiratory disorders. A course of action should therefore be planned in advance; with necessary drugs and equipment available for immediate treatment should a serious reaction occur. Transitory changes in serum iron (within the normal range in the majority of cases) have been observed in some patients after administration of Gadodiamide. The clinical significance of this, if any, is not known but all patients in whom this effect was observed remained asymptomatic. Gadodiamide interferes with serum calcium measurements with some colorimetric (complexometric) methods commonly used in hospitals. It may also interfere with determinations of other electrolytes (e.g. iron). Thus it is recommended that such methods not be used for 12-24 hours after administration of Gadodiamide. If such measurements are necessary, the use of other methods is recommended. Diagnostic procedures involving the use of contrast agents should be conducted under supervision of a physician with the prerequisite training and a thorough knowledge of the procedure to be performed. If Gadodiamide is drawn into a disposable syringe it should be used immediately. If non-disposable equipment is used, scrupulous care should be taken to prevent residual contamination with traces of cleansing agents.Data on the safety of repeated injections are not available. If the physician determines sequential or repeat examinations are required, a suitable time interval between administrations should be observed to allow for clearance of the drug from the body. In some patients with severely impaired renal function (GFR<10 ml/min), further small reductions in GFR and increases in serum creatinine have been observed after administration of Gadodiamide. Since the clinical relevance of these findings is not fully known, care should be exercised before using Gadodiamide in such patients.",

The doses in rats and rabbits were respectively 16 and 10 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area. Gadosol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Lactation: It is not known whether Gadoteric Acid is excreted in human milk. Limited case reports on use of GBCAs in nursing mothers indicate that 0.01 to 0.04% of the maternal gadolinium dose is excreted in human breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, exercise caution when Gadoteric Acid is administered to a nursing woman.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Gefapixant is a selective antagonist of the P2X3 receptor. P2X3-containing receptors belong to the family of purinergic receptors and are ATP-dependent ion channels, which are also located on sensory C-fibers of the vagus nerve in the airways. C-fibers are activated in response to inflammation or chemical irritants. Under inflammatory conditions, ATP is released by mucosal cells of the respiratory tract. The binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 receptors is recognized by C-fibers as a damage signal and is perceived as a coughing stimulus, which in turn triggers a cough reflex. Gefapixant blocks ATP-mediated activation of P2X3 receptors, which are thought to be responsible for chronic cough.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Treatment with Gefapixant should be initiated and monitored by physicians experienced in managing patients with chronic cough disorders.Adult patients: One 45 mg tablet orally twice daily with or without food. Patients should be advised that if a missed dose is missed, they should skip it and take the next dose at the regular time.Use in elderly patients: No dose adjustment of Gefapixant due to age is required and no age-specific differences in the efficacy or safety of Gefapixant has been established. This medicine is essentially excreted by the kidneys. Since older patients are more likely to have impaired renal function, the risk of adverse effects may be higher in these patients. Caution should be exercised at the initial dosing frequency.Use in the pediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Gefapixant have not been established in patients below 18 years of age.Obstructive sleep apnea: Gefapixant should not be used in patients with refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough and comorbid obstructive sleep apnoea.Patients with liver disease: Gefapixant has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.Patients with renal impairment: The recommended dose of Gefapixant in patients with severe impairment (eGFR<30 ml/minute/1.73 m2) renal function on non-dialysis is one 45 mg tablet once daily with or without food.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Gemcitabine (dFdC) is metabolised intracellularly by nucleoside kinases to the active diphosphate (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. The cytotoxic action of Gemcitabine appears to be due to inhibition of DNA synthesis by two actions of dFdCDP and dFdCTP. First, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase which is uniquely responsible for catalysing the reactions that generate the deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme by dFdCDP causes a reduction in the concentrations of deoxynucleosides in general, and especially in that of dCTP. Secondly, dFdCTP competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. Likewise, a small amount of Gemcitabine may also be incorporated into RNA. Thus, the reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA (self-potentiation). DNA polymerase epsilon is essentially unable to remove Gemcitabine and repair the growing DNA strands. After Gemcitabine is incorporated into DNA, one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands. After this addition, there is essentially a complete inhibition in further DNA synthesis (masked chain termination). After incorporation into DNA, Gemcitabine then appears to induce the programmed cellular death process known as apoptosis.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: \n\nSingle-agent Use: The recommended dose of Gemcitabine is 1000 mg/m2, given by 30-minute intravenous infusion. This should be repeated once weekly for three weeks, followed by a one-week rest period. This four-week cycle is then repeated. Dosage reduction with each cycle or within a cycle may be applied based upon the amount of toxicity experienced by the patient.\nCombination Use: Gemcitabine, in combination with Cisplatin has been investigated using two dosing regimens. One regimen used a three-week schedule and the over used a four-week schedule. The three-week schedule used Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2, given by 30-minute intravenous infusion, on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. Dosage reduction with each cycle or within a cycle may be applied based upon the amount of toxicity experienced by the patient.

    "Interaction": "No confirmed interactions have been reported with the use of Gemcitabine. No specific drug interaction studies have been conducted.",
    "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Gemcitabine or any other components of this product.",
    "Side Effects": "Haematological Toxicity: Because Gemcitabine is a bone marrow suppressant, anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia can occur as a result of administration of Gemcitabine. Myelosuppression is usually mild to moderate and is more pronounced for the granulocyte count. While two-thirds of patients experience some anaemia, only 7% have haemoglobin levels drop below 8 g/100 mL. While 19% of patients received transfusions, only 0.2% of patients discontinued because of anaemia. The white blood cell count is depressed in 61 % of patients, however only 9% of patients experience WBC's below 2000 cells/mm 3 and only 0.1% discontinued for leukopenia. Sixty-four percent of patients have reduced granulocyte counts and almost 25% drop below 1000 cells/mm 3 . Platelet counts are reduced in 21% of patients but only 5% of patients experience counts below 50,000 cells/mm 3 and only 0.4% of patients were discontinued due to thrombocytopenia. Previous therapy with cytotoxic agents appears to increase the frequency and severity of the leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. There is no evidence of cumulative haematological toxicity. Anaemia is manageable with the use of conventional transfusions. Dose reduction or omission may be necessary for severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Rare cases of haemorrhage occurring simultaneously with thrombocytopenia have been reported, but were usually thought to be disease-related. Thrombocythemia is also commonly reported (7.5% of patients), but no patients were discontinued for this event. Febrile neutropenia is also commonly reported.Hepatic Toxicity: Abnormalities of liver transaminase enzymes occur in about two-thirds of patients, but they are usually mild, non- progressive, and rarely necessitate stopping treatment. Less than 10% of patients experience elevations greater than 5 times normal and only 0.5% of patients were discontinued for abnormalities in liver function. One patient was discontinued for liver failure, but the assessment was complicated by a history of chronic alcoholism. Alanine transaminase (ALT) effects decline over time despite continued treatment. Elevations of alkaline phosphatase greater than 5 times normal occurred in 6.6% of patients but may have been due to bone disorders. Bilirubin values greater than 5 times normal were observed in 1.5% of patients, but ninety percent of patients had normal bilirubin levels.Gastrointestinal: Nausea, and nausea accompanied by vomiting are each reported in about one-third of patients, respectively. This adverse event requires therapy in about 20% of patients, is rarely dose-limiting, and is easily manageable with standard antiemetics. Only 0.9% of patients report intractable vomiting and only 0.9% of patients discontinued due to nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea and stomatitis are commonly reported. Diarrhoea (transient to tolerable) was reported by 7% of patients. Intolerable diarrhoea requiring therapy was reported in 0.5% of patients. No patients discontinued treatment because of diarrhoea.Genito-Urinary Toxicity: Mild proteinuria and haematuria are reported in approximately half the patients, but are rarely clinically significant, and are not usually associated with any change in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen. However, a few cases (0.6% of patients) of renal failure of uncertain aetiology have been reported hence Gemcitabine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function. Rare cases (0.4%) of possible haemolytic uraemic syndrome have been reported. Cumulative renal toxicity has not been observed.Pulmonary Toxicity: Dyspnoea occurring within hours following Gemcitabine injection is reported by approximately 10% of patients. This dyspnoea is usually mild and short-lived, rarely dose-limiting, and usually abates spontaneously without any specific therapy. The mechanism of this toxicity is unknown and the relationship to Gemcitabine is not clear. Only 0.6% of patients discontinued due to dyspnoea and only 0.1 % of these were believed to be medicine-related. Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported infrequently.Allergic Toxicity: A rash is seen in approximately 25% of patients and is associated with pruritus in about 10% of patients. The rash is usually mild, not dose-limiting, and responds to local therapy. Desquamation, vesiculation, and ulceration have been reported rarely. Discontinuations for cutaneous toxicity were reported for only 0.3% of patients. Gemcitabine is well tolerated during the infusion with only a few cases of injection site reaction reported. Gemcitabine does not appear to be a vesicant. There have been no reports of injection site necrosis. Bronchospasm is usually mild and transient, but parenteral therapy may be required. Gemcitabine should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to the medicine.Neurotoxicity: Mild to moderate somnolence occurs in approximately 10% of patients. Only 0.1 % of patients discontinued for somnolence. Asthenia is frequently reported with other flu symptoms but is also reported as an isolated symptom. Asthenia was cause for discontinuation by 1.4% of patients. Paresthesias are reported in 3.4% of patients, but only 0.2% report these as severe. Oedema/Peripheral Oedema : Oedema/peripheral oedema is reported by approximately 30% of patients. Some cases of facial oedema have also been reported. Pulmonary oedema was reported infrequently (1%). Oedema/peripheral oedema is usually mild to moderate, rarely dose-limiting, is sometimes reported as painful and is usually reversible after stopping Gemcitabine treatment.

    "Indications": "Gemfibrozil is used as a hypolipidemic agent in conjunction with dietary modification. It is recommended in the treatment of type IIa, type IIb, type III, type IV and type V hyperlipoproteinemia.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Gemfibrozil is an anti-lipemic agent. Gemfibrozil decreases serum triglycerides in healthy individuals and patients with hyper-triglyceridemia. It decreases very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)- triglyceride concentration and to a lesser extent, LDL triglyceride concentration. HDL-triglyceride is usually decreased slightly. Gemfibrozil usually increases the HDL-cholesterol fraction in healthy individuals and patients with hyperlipoproteinemia, an action that may be beneficial in slowing the progression of atherosclerosis and in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.Gemfibrozil also inhibits synthesis of VLDL carrier apolipoprotein B, leading to a decrease in VLDL production. How gemfibrozil raises HDL concentration is not known. Gemfibrozil inhibits lipolysis of fat in adipose tissue and decreases the hepatic uptake of plasma free fatty acids, thereby reducing hepatic triglyceride production.Gemfibrozil is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak concentration in plasma occurs within 1 to 2 hours; the half-life is about 1.5 hours. About 70% of a dose is excreted in the urine; little is excreted in the faeces.",

The GV+ interacts with negatively charged components of bacterial cells including the lipopolysaccharide (on the cell wall), the peptidoglycan and DNA. A similar cell penetration and DNA binding process is thought to take place for fungal cells as well. Because Gentian violet is a mutagen and mitotic poison, cell growth is consequently inhibited. A photodynamic action of gentian violet, apparently mediated by a free-radical mechanism, has recently been described in bacteria and in the protozoan T. cruzi. Evidence also suggests that gentian violet dissipates the bacterial (and mitochondrial) membrane potential by inducing permeability. This is followed by respiratory inhibition. This anti-mitochondrial activity might explain gentian violet's efficacy towards both bacteria and yeast with relatively mild effects on mammalian cells.",

There are no available data on Gilteritinib use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, administration of Gilteritinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality, suppressed fetal growth, and teratogenicity at maternal exposures (AUC24) approximately 0.4 times the AUC24 in patients receiving the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.Lactation: There are no data on the presence of Gilteritinib and/or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Following administration of radiolabeled Gilteritinib to lactating rats, milk concentrations of radioactivity were higher than radioactivity in maternal plasma at 4 and 24 hours post-dose. In animal studies, Gilteritinib and/or its metabolite(s) were distributed to the tissues in infant rats via the milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with Gilteritinib and for at least 2 months after the last dose.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Differentiation Syndrome: Of 319 patients treated with Gilteritinib in the clinical trials, 3% experienced differentiation syndrome. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal if not treated. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with Gilteritinib included fever, dyspnea, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, hypotension, rapid weight gain, peripheral edema, rash, and renal dysfunction. Some cases had concomitant acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 2 days and up to 75 days after Gilteritinib initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. Of the 11 patients who experienced differentiation syndrome, 9 (82%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of Gilteritinib. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours (or an equivalent dose of an alternative oral or IV corticosteroid) and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement. Taper corticosteroids after resolution of symptoms and administer corticosteroids for a minimum of 3 days. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment. If severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids, interrupt Gilteritinib until signs and symptoms are no longer severe.Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome: Of 319 patients treated with Gilteritinib in the clinical trials, 1% experienced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) with symptoms including seizure and altered mental status. Symptoms have resolved after discontinuation of Gilteritinib. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Discontinue Gilteritinib in patients who develop PRES.Prolonged QT Interval: Gilteritinib has been associated with prolonged cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT interval). Of the 317 patients with a post-baseline QTc measurement on treatment with Gilteritinib in the clinical trial, 1% were found to have a QTc interval greater than 500 msec and 7% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec. Perform electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiation of treatment withGilteritinib, on days 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and prior to the start of the next two subsequent cycles. Interrupt and reduce Gilteritinib dosage in patients who have a QTcF >500 msec. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may increase the QT prolongation risk. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to and during Gilteritinib administration.Pancreatitis: Of 319 patients treated with Gilteritinib in the clinical trials, 4% experienced pancreatitis. Evaluate patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Interrupt and reduce the dose of Gilteritinib in patients who develop pancreatitis.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, Gilteritinib can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of Gilteritinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal lethality, suppressed fetal growth and teratogenicity at maternal exposures (AUC24) approximately 0.4 times the AUC24 in patients receiving the recommended dose. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gilteritinib and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Gilteritinib. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gilteritinib and for at least 4 months after the last dose of Gilteritinib. Pregnant women, patients becoming pregnant while receiving Gilteritinib or male patients with pregnant female partners should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Glecaprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease, which is a viral enzyme necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. These multifunctional proteins, including NS3, are essential for viral replication. The N-terminal of NS3 protein confers serine protease activity, whileThe C-terminus of NS3 encodes a DExH/D-box RNA helicase which hydyolyzes NTP as an energy source to unwind double-stranded RNA in a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction during replication of viral genomic RNA. NS4A is a cofactor for NS3 that directs the localization of NS3 and modulates its enzymatic activities. Glecaprevir disrupts the intracellular processes of the viral life cycle through inhibiting the NS3/4A protease activity of cleaving downstream junctions of HCV polypeptide and proteolytic processing of mature structural protein.NS5A is a phosphoprotein that plays an essential role in replication, assembly and maturation of infectious viral proteins. The basal phosphorylated form of NS5A, which is maintained by C-terminal serine cluster, is key in ensuring its interaction with the viral capsid protein, or the core protein. By blocking this interaction, pibrentasvir inhibits the assembly of proteins and production of mature HCV particles. NS5A also interacts with viral and cellular proteins to form the HCV replicase complex, and supports the RNA replication of HCV",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Glibenclamide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The mechanism by which Glibenclamide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. With chronic administration of Glibenclamide in Type 2 diabetic patients, the blood glucose lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory response to the drug. In addition to its blood glucose lowering actions, Glibenclamide produces a mild diuresis by enhancement of renal free water clearance.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with Glibenclamide or any other hypoglycemic agent. The usual starting dose of Glibenclamide as initial therapy is 2.5 to 5 mg daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal.Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 1.25 mg daily.The usual maintenance dose is in the range of 1.25 to 20 mg daily, which may be given as a single dose or in divided doses. Dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than 2.5 mg at weekly intervals based upon the patient's blood glucose response. Daily doses of more than 20 mg are not recommended.",
    "Interaction": "The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, ACE inhibitors, fluoxetine, clarithromycin, and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glibenclamide, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Glibenclamide, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control. A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.",
    "Contraindications": "Glibenclamide is contraindicated in patients:\n\nWith known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its excipients.\nWith type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. These conditions should be treated with insulin.",

Gliclazide is used in a certain form of diabetes (type 2 diabetes Mellitus) in adults, when diet, exercise and weight loss alone do not have an adequate effect on keeping blood sugar at the correct level.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Gliclazide is a second generation sulfonylurea drug that has hypoglycaemic and potentially useful hematological properties. It stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic \u03b2-cells by facilitating Ca+2\u00a0 transport across the \u03b2-cell membranes and decreases hepatic glucose output.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Film-coated tablet: The usual initial dose is 40 to 80 mg daily. The dose can be increased up to 320 mg daily in divided doses when needed. The drug should be taken before meal. For children, Gliclazide is not used because it is contraindicated in juvenile-onset diabetes.Modified release preparation: Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is determined by the doctor, depending on your blood and possibly urine sugar levels. Change in external factors (weight reduction, lifestyle, stress) or improvements in the blood sugar control may require changed gliclazide doses.The recommended daily dose is one to four tablets (maximum 120 mg) in a single intake at breakfast time. This depends on the response to treatment. Gliclazide MR tablet is for oral use. Take your tablet(s) with a glass of water at breakfast time (and preferably at the same time each day). Swallow your whole tablet(s) in one piece. Do not chew or crush. You must always eat a meal after taking your tablet(s).If a combination therapy of gliclazide with metformin, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor a GLP-1 receptor agonist or insulin is initiated your doctor will determine the proper dose of each medicine individually for you. If you notice that your blood sugar levels are high although you are taking the medicine as prescribed, you should contact your doctor or pharmacist.If you take more Gliclazide tablets than you should: If you take too many tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital Accident & Emergency department immediately. The signs of overdose are those of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). The symptoms can be helped by taking sugar (4 to 6 lumps) or sugary drinks straight away, followed by a substantial snack or meal. If the patient is unconscious immediately inform a doctor and call the emergency services. The same should be done if somebody, (for instance a child), has taken the product unintentionally. Unconscious patients must not be given food or drink. It should be ensured that there is always a pre-informed person that can call a doctor in case of emergency.If you forget to take Gliclazide tablet: It is important to take your medicine every day as regular treatment works better. However, if you forget to take a dose of Gliclazide MR tablet, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.If you stop taking Gliclazide MR tablet: As the treatment for diabetes is usually lifelong, you should discuss with your doctor before stopping this medicinal product. Stopping could cause high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) which increases the risk of developing complications of diabetes. If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.",
    "Interaction": "Other medicines and Gliclazide: Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. The blood sugar lowering effect of gliclazide may be strengthened and signs of low blood sugar levels may occur when one of the follow ng medicines is taken:\n\nother medicines used to treat high blood sugar (oral antidiabetics, GLP-1 receptor agonists or insulin),\nantibiotics (sulphonamides, clarithromycin)\nmedicines to treat high blood pressure or heart failure (beta-blockers.

Consult your doctor before you start taking another medicinal product. If you go into hospital tell the medical staff you are taking gliclazide.Gliclazide with food and drink: Gliclazide can be taken with food and non-alcoholic drinks. Drinking alcohol is not recommended as it can alter the control of your diabetes in an unpredictable manner.Driving and using machines: Your ability to concentrate or react may be impaired if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), or too high (hyperglycaemia) or if you develop visual problems as a result of such conditions. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or others (for instance when driving a car or using machines). Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car if you:\n\nhave frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\nhave few or no warning signals of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\n\r\nGliclazide contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.",
    "Contraindications": "Do not take Gliclazide:\n\nif you are allergic to gliclazide or to other medicines of the same group (sulfonylurea), or to other related medicines (hypoglycaemic sulfonamides)\nif you have insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1)\nif you have ketone bodies and sugar in your urine (this may mean you have diabetic ketoacidosis), a diabetic pre-coma or coma\nif you have severe kidney or liver disease\nif you are taking medicines to treat fungal infections\nif you are breastfeeding",
    "Side Effects": "Like all medicines, Gliclazide can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most commonly observed side effect is low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If left untreated these symptoms could progress to drowsiness, loss of consciousness or possibly coma. If an episode of low blood sugar is severe or prolonged, even if it is temporarily controlled by eating sugar, you should seek immediate medical attention.Liver disorders: There have been isolated reports of abnormal iiver function, which can cause yellow skin and eyes. If you get this, see your doctor immediately. The symptoms generally disappear if the medicine is stopped. Your doctor will decide whether to stop your treatment.Skin disorders: Skin reactions such as rash, redness, itching, hives, blisters, angioedema (rapid swelling of tissues such as eyelids, face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat that may result in breathing difficulty) have been reported. Rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the skin. If you develop this, stop taking, seek urgent advice from a doctor and tell him that you are taking this medicine. Exceptionally, signs of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported: initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high temperature.Blood disorders: Decrease in the number of cells in the blood (e.g. platelets, red and white blood cells) which may cause paleness, prolonged bleeding, bruising, sore throat and fever have been reported. These symptoms usually vanish when the treatment is discontinued.Digestive disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, diarrhoea, and constipation. These effects are reduced when Gliclazide is taken with a meal as recommended.Eye disorders: Your vision may be affected for a short time especially at the start of treatment. This effect is due to changes in blood sugar levels. As for another sulfonylurea, the following adverse events have been observed: cases of severe changes in the number of blood cells and allergic inflammation of the wall of blood vessels, reduction in blood sodium (hyponatraemia), symptoms of liver impairment (for instance jaundice) which in most cases disappeared after withdrawal of the sulfonylurea, but may lead to life-threatening liver failure in isolated cases.Reporting of side effects: If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.",

    "Precautions & Warnings": "Talk to your doctor before taking Gliclazide. You should observe the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor to achieve proper blood sugar levels. This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During gliclazide treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased. So particularly close medical monitoring is necessary.Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) may occur:\n\nif you take meals irregularly or skip meals altogether,\nif you are fasting\nif you are malnourished\nif you change your diet\nif you increase your physical activity and carbohydrate intake does not match this increase,\nif you drink alcohol, especially in combination with skipped meals,\nif you take other medicines or natural remedies at the same time,\nif you take too high doses of gliclazide,\nif you suffer from particular hormone-induced disorders (functional disorders of the thyroid gland, pituitary gland or adrenal cortex),\nif your kidney function or liver function is severely decreased.\n\r\nif you have low blood sugar you may have the following symptoms: headache, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, weariness, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggressiveness, poor concentration, reduced alertness and reaction time, depression, confusion, speech or visual disorders, tremor, sensory disturbances, dizziness and helplessness.The following signs and symptoms may also occur: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, sudden strong pain in the chest that may radiate into nearby areas (angina pectoris).If blood sugar levels continue to drop you may suffer from considerable confusion (delirium), develop convulsions, lose self-control, your breathing may be shallow and your heartbeat slowed down, you may become unconscious.In most cases the symptoms of low blood sugar vanish very quickly when you consume .some form of sugar, (for instance, glucose tablets, sugar cubes, sweet juice, sweetened tea).You should therefore always carry some form of sugar with you (glucose tablets, sugar cubes). Remember that artificial sweeteners are not effective. Please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital if taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms recur.Symptoms of low blood sugar may be absent, less obvious or develop very slowly or you are not aware in time that your blood sugar level has dropped. This may happen if you are an elderly patient taking certain medicines (for instance those acting on the central nervous system and beta-blockers).If you are in stressful situations (e.g. accidents, surgical operations, fever etc.) your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin therapy.Symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) may occur when gliclazide has not yet sufficiently reduced the blood sugar when you have not complied with the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor if you take St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations or in special stress situations. These may include thirst, frequent urination, dry mouth, dry itchy skin, skin infections and reduced performance.Blood glucose disturbances (low blood sugar and high bold sugar) can occur when Gliclazide is prescribed at the same time as medicines to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, especially in elderly patients. In this case, your doctor will remind you of the importance of monitoring your blood glucose.If you have a family history of or know you have the hereditary condition glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (abnormality of red blood cells), lowering of the haemoglobin level and breakdown of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia) can occur.

This should be taken into account when glimepiride is coadministered with inducers (e.g. rifampicin) or inhibitors (e.g. fuconazole) of CYP 2C9.\nPotentiation of the blood-glucose-lowering efect and, thus, in some instances hypoglycaemia may occur when one of the following drugs is taken, for example: insulin and other, oral antidiabetics; ACE inhibitors; anabolic steroids and male sex hormones; chloramphenicol; coumarin derivatives; cyclophosphamide; disopyramide; fenfuramine; fenyramidol; fbrates; fuoxetine; guanethidine; ifosfamide; MAO inhibitors; miconazole; fuconazole; para-aminosalicylic acid; pentoxifylline (high dose parenteral); phenylbutazone; azapropazone; oxyphenbutazone; probenecid; quinolones; salicylates; sulfnpyrazone; clarithromycin; sulfonamide antibiotics; tetracyclines; tritoqualine; trofosfamide.\nWeakening of the blood-glucose-lowering efect and, thus raised blood glucose levels may occur when one of the following drugs is taken, for example: acetazolamide; barbiturates; corticosteroids; diazoxide; diuretics; epinephrine (adrenaline) and other sympathomimetic agents; glucagon; laxatives (after protracted use); nicotinic acid (in high doses); oestrogens and progestogens; phenothiazines; phenytoin; rifampicin; thyroid hormones.\nH2 receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, clonidine and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the blood-glucose-lowering efect. Under the infuence of sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation to hypoglycaemia may be reduced or absent.\nBoth acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering action of glimepiride in an unpredictable fashion.\nThe efect of coumarin derivatives may be potentiated or weakened.\nBile acid sequestrant: Colesevelam binds to glimepiride and reduces glimepiride absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Glimepiride should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.\n\r\nFor Metformin: Concomitant use not recommended: \n\nAlcohol: Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in case of fasting, malnutrition or hepatic insufciency. Avoid consumption of alcohol and alcohol-containing medications\nIodinated contrast agents: Metformin must be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.\nCombinations requiring precautions for use: Some medicinal products can adversely afect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic Acidosis. When starting or using such products in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. Glucocorticoids, beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic hyperglycemic activity. Inform the patient and perform more frequent blood glucose monitoring. ACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels. Metformin may decrease the anticoagulant efect of phenprocoumon. Therefore, a close monitoring of the INR is recommended. Levothyroxine can reduce the hypoglycemic efect of metformin. Monitoring of blood glucose levels is recommended, especially when thyroid hormone therapy is initiated or stopped, and the dosage of metformin must be adjusted if necessary.\n\r\nOrganic cation transporters (OCT): Metformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2. Co-administration of metformin with:\n\nInhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efcacy of metformin.\nInducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efcacy of metformin.\nInhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprime, vandetanib, isavuconazole) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in metformin plasma concentration.\nInhibitors of both OCT1 and OCT2 (such as crizotinib, olaparib) may alter efcacy and renal elimination of metformin.\n\r\nCaution is therefore advised, especially in patients with renal impairment, when these drugs are coadministered with metformin, as metformin plasma concentration may increase. If needed, dose adjustment of metformin may be considered as OCT inhibitors/inducers may alter the efcacy of metformin.",

    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy-\n\nFor Glimepiride: Glimepiride must not be taken during pregnancy. Otherwise, there is risk of harm to the child. The patient must change over to insulin during pregnancy. Patients planning a pregnancy must inform their physician. It is recommended that such patients change over to insulin.\nFor Metformin: When the patient plans to become pregnant and during pregnancy, diabetes should not be treated with metformin but insulin should be used to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible in order to lower the risk of fetal malformations associated with abnormal blood glucose levels.\n\r\nLactation-\n\nFor Glimepiride: To prevent possible ingestion with the breast milk and possible harm to the child, glimepiride must not be taken by breast-feeding women. If necessary the patient must change over to insulin, or must stop breastfeeding.\nFor Metformin: Metformin is excreted into milk in lactating rats. Similar data is not available in humans and a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue metformin, taking into account the importance of the compound to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "For Glimepiride: In the initial weeks of treatment, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased and necessitates especially careful monitoring. If risk factors for hypoglycemia are present, it may be necessary to adjust the dosage of glimepiride or the entire therapy. This also applies whenever illness occurs during therapy or the patient's life-style changes. It is known from other sulfonylureas that, despite initially successful countermeasures, hypoglycaemia may recur. Patients must, therefore, remain under close observation. Severe hypoglycaemia further requires immediate treatment and follow-up by a physician and, in some circumstances, in-patient hospital care. Treatment of patients with G6PD-defciency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anaemia. Since glimepiride belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD-defciency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered.For Metformin: Regular monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is recommended in patients withhypothyroidism. Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 serumlevels which may cause peripheral neuropathy. Monitoring of the vitamin B12 level is recommended.",

Read moreGlipizide\u00a0is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the control of hyperglycaemia and its associated symptomatology in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM type II) when diet modification has not been proved effective on its own. In certain patients who are receiving insulin, the concurrent use of Glipizide would allow a reduction in the daily dose of insulin.Use of Glipizide must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to diet and not as a substitute for diet or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint. Furthermore, short term administration may be required if diet control alone results in transient control of blood glucose level. During maintenance, if satisfactory lowering of blood glucose is no longer achieved, use of Glipizide should be discontinued.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Glipizide lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells. The extrapancreatic effects of Glipizide are increase in insulin sensitivity and decrease in hepatic glucose production.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Like any other oral hypoglycaemic agent, dosage of Glipizide is not fixed and may be adjusted through periodic monitoring of blood glucose level. Short term administration of Glipizide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control of blood glucose in patients, usually controlled well on diet.In general, Glipizide should be given approximately 30 minutes before a meal to achieve the maximum reduction in postprandial hyperglycaemia.\n\nInitial dose: The recommended starting dose is 5 mg, given before breakfast. Geriatric patients or those with liver disease may be started on 2.5 mg.\nDosage adjustments: Dosage adjustment may be done at intervals of several days by an increment of 2.5-5 mg, as determined by blood glucose response. If response to a single dose is not satisfactory, dividing that dose might prove effective. The maximum recommended once daily dose is 15 mg. Doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided and given before meals of adequate calorie content. The maximum recommended total daily dose is 40 mg.\nMaintenance: Some patients may be effectively controlled on a once daily regimen, while others show better response with divided dosing. Total daily dose above 30 mg have been safely given on bid basis to long term patients. Patients can usually be stabilized on a dosage ranging from 2.5 to 30 mg daily.\n\nIn elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with impaired renal or hepatic function:\u00a0The initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions.Patients receiving insulin: Many stable non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving Insulin may be safely placed on Glipizide if the physician decides to do so.Patients receiving other oral hypoglycaemic agents: As with other sulphonylurea, no transition period is necessary while transferring patients to Glipizide. Patients should be observed carefully for any possible hypoglycaemic effect due to overlapping of drug effects.Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.",
    "Interaction": "The hypoglycaemic action of sulphonylurea may be potentiated by certain drugs including non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound e.g., Salicylates, Sulphonamides, Chloramphenicol, Probenecid, Coumarins, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, and \u03b2 adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glipizide, the patients should be observed closely for hypoglycaemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control on blood glucose.Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycaemia and may lead to loss of control on blood glucose. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, oestrogens, oral contraceptives, Phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs and Isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to or withdrawn from a patient receiving Glipizide, the patient should be closely observed for loss of control on blood glucose. Diabetic control may be altered also in patients treated with cyclophosphamide.",
    "Contraindications": "Glipizide is contraindicated in the following conditions :\n\nPatients who are hypersensitive to Glipizide or any component of the product\nJuvenile onset diabetes\nSevere or unstable \u2018brittle\u2019 diabetes\nDiabetes complicated by ketosis and acidosis, major surgery, severe sepsis or severe trauma\nSevere renal, hepatic or thyroid impairment, co-existent renal and hepatic disease",
    "Side Effects": "The majority of side effects have been dose related, transient, and responded to dose reduction or withdrawal of the medication.Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal complaints were reported with the following approximate incidences like nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and gastralgia. They appear to be dose related and usually disappear on division or reduction of dosage. Cholestatic jaundice may occur rarely with these kind of drugs and Glipizide should be discontinued if this occurs.Dermatological: Allergic skin reactions including erythema, morbilliform or maculopapular eruption, urticaria, pruritus and eczema have been reported. They frequently disappear with continued therapy. However, if they persist, the drug should be discontinued.Haematologic: Leucopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia and pancytopenia have been reported with sulphonylureas.Metabolic: Hepatic porphyria and disulphiram like reactions have been reported with sulphonylurea.Endocrine reactions: Cases of hyponatraemia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion have been reported with this and other sulphonylureas.Miscellaneous: Dizziness, drowsiness and headache have been reported in patients treated with Glipizide. They are usually transient and seldom require discontinuation of therapy.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Glipizide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Prolonged severe hypoglycaemia (4-10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving sulphonylurea (e.g., Glipizide) at the time of delivery. So, if Glipizide is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least one month before the expected delivery date.Lactation: Although it is not known whether Glipizide is excreted in human milk, some sulphonylurea drugs are known to be so. Breast feeding is not therefore recommended while taking this medication.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hypoglycaemia: All sulphonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycaemia. Proper patient selection, dosage and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycaemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated blood levels of Glipizide and the latter may also diminis gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycaemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycaemic actions of glucose lowering drugs. Patients should be instructed to take their meals regularly and not to exercise excessively without additional calorie intake.Renal and hepatic disease: The metabolism and excretion of Glipizide may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function. These patients may suffer from prolonged hypoglycaemia and appropriate measures should be instituted.Loss of control on blood glucose: When a patient stabilized on any antidiabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection or surgery, a loss of control on blood glucose may occur. At that time it may be necessary to discontinue Glipizide and administer Insulin. The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycaemic drug including Glipizide, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level, decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to secondary failure, i.e., progression of the severity of the diabetes or diminished responsiveness to the drug.",

    "Pharmacology": "Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent, which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacological mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylurea, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patient with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.Glipizide is a sulfonylurea which appears to lower blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.",

Glipizide & Metformin as Second-Line Therapy: The recommended starting dose is 500 mg/2.5 mg or 500 mg/5 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2000 mg Metformin/20 mg Glipizide.",
    "Interaction": "Cimetidine reduces the renal clearance of Metformin. Alcohol potentiates the antihyperglycemic & hyperlactataemic effect of Metformin. It may enhance the effects of anti-coagulants. Such patients receiving the two drugs may need adjustment of the anti-coagulant dosage.

    "Precautions & Warnings": "Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis is increased with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus, patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal should not receive Metformin. In patients with advanced age, Metformin should be carefully titrated to establish minimum dose for adequate glycemic control, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. Metformin therapy should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure and should not be restarted until the patient\u2019s oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal. During concomitant therapy with sulfonylurea, blood glucose should be monitored. Metformin & insulin therapy should be carried out in hospital until the correct ratio of the two drugs has been established. The metabolism and excretion of Glipizide may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function. If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Glycopyrronium bromide is a quaternary ammonium antimuscarinic with peripheral effects. It is used in anesthetic practice. Given as a premedication before general anesthesia, it diminishes the risk of vagal inhibition of the heart and reduces salivary and bronchial secretions. Intra-operatively, it may be given to reduce bradycardia and hypotension induced by drugs such as suxamethonium, halothane or propofol. Glycopyrronium bromide may be used before or with anticholinesterases such as neostigmine to prevent their muscarinic adverse effects. Antimuscarinic drugs are competitive inhibitors of the actions of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors of autonomic effector sites innervated by parasympathetic(cholinergic postganglionic) nerves, as well as being inhibitors of the action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle lacking cholinergic innervation. Peripheral antimuscarinic effects that are produced as the dose increases are: decreased production of secretions from the salivary, bronchial and sweat glands; dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) and paralysis of accommodation (cyclopegia); increased heart rate; inhibition of micturition and reduction in gastrointestinal tone; inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Quaternary ammonium compounds are sparingly lipid soluble and do not readily pass lipid membranes such as the blood brain barrier. Central effects are negligible.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Pre-anesthetic Use:\n\nAdults: 0.2 mg to 0.4 mg intravenously or intramuscularly before the induction of anesthesia. Alternatively, a dose of 0.004 to 0.005 mg/kg up to a maximum of 0.4 mg may be used. Larger doses may result in profound and prolonged antisialogogue effect, which may be unpleasant for the patient.\nChildren (1 month to 12 years of age): 0.004 to 0.008 mg/kg up to a maximum of 0.2 mg intravenously or intramuscularly before the induction of anesthesia. Larger doses may result in profound and prolonged antisialogogue effect which may be unpleasant for the patient.\n\nIntraoperative Use: When used to treat arrhythmias associated with traction reflexes, the usual attempts should be made to determine the aetiology of the arrhythmia and the surgical or anesthetic manipulations necessary to correct parasympathetic imbalance should be performed.\n\n\nAdults: In those situations where intraoperative use is indicated, a single dose of 0.2 to 0.4 mg (or 0.004 to 0.005 mg/kg up to a maximum of 0.4 mg) by intravenous injection should be used. This dose may be repeated if necessary.\nChildren (1 month to 12 years of age): In those situations where intraoperative use is indicated, a single dose of 0.004 to 0.008 mg/kg or up to a maximum of 0.2 mg by intravenous injection should be used. This dose may be repeated if necessary.\n\nReversal of Neuromuscular Blockade:\n\nAdults: 0.2 mg intravenously per 1 mg neostigmine or the equivalent dose of pyridostigmine. Alternatively, a dose of 0.01-0.015 mg intravenously with 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine or equivalent dose of pyridostigmine. Glycopyrronium may be administered simultaneously from the same syringe with the anticholinesterase; greater cardiovascular stability results from this method of administration.\nChildren (1 month to 12 years of age): 0.01 mg/kg intravenously with 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine or the equivalent dose of pyridostigmine. Glycopyrronium may be administered simultaneously from the same syringe with the anticholinesterase; greater cardiovascular stability results from this method of administration.",
    "Interaction": "Many drugs have antimuscarinic effects; concomitant use of two or more of such drugs can increase side-effects such as dry mouth, urine retention and constipation. Concomitant use can also lead to confusion in the elderly. Anticholinergic agents may delay absorption of other medication given concomitantly. Concurrent administration of anticholingergics and corticosteroids may result in increased intraocular pressure.

There was no evidence of the golimumab antibody binding to other TNF superfamily ligands; in particular, the golimumab antibody did not bind or neutralize human lymphotoxin. Golimumab did not lyse human monocytes expressing transmembrane TNF in the presence of complement or effector cells.Elevated TNF\u03b1 levels in the blood, synovium, and joints have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. TNF\u03b1 is an important mediator of the articular inflammation that is characteristic of these diseases. The exact mechanism by which golimumab treats ulcerative colitis is unknown. Golimumab modulated the in vitro biological effects mediated by TNF in several bioassays, including the expression of adhesion proteins responsible for leukocyte infiltration (E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF).",

Clinical studies suggest the addition of Hormone Replacement Therapy (estrogens and/or progestins) to Goserelin is effective in reducing the bone mineral loss\nwhich occurs with Goserelin alone without compromising the efficacy of Goserelin in relieving the symptoms of endometriosis. The addition of Hormone Replacement Therapy may also reduce the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness associated with hypoestrogenism. The optimal drugs, dose and duration of treatment has not been established.\nEndometrial Thinning: For use as an endometrial-thinning agent prior to endometrial ablation, the dosing recommendation is one or two depots (with each depot given four weeks apart). When one depot is administered, surgery should be performed at four weeks. When two depots are administered, surgery should be performed within two to four weeks following administration of the second depot.\nBreast Cancer: For the management of advanced breast cancer, Goserelin is intended for long-term administration unless clinically inappropriate.\nRenal or Hepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\n\nGoserelin 10.8 mg: should be administered subcutaneously every 12 weeks into the anterior abdominal wall below the navel line using an aseptic technique under the supervision of a physician. While a delay of a few days is permissible, every effort should be made to adhere to the 12-week schedule.\n\nStage B2-C Prostatic Carcinoma: When Goserelin is given in combination with radiotherapy and flutamide for patients with Stage T2b-T4 (Stage B2-C) prostatic carcinoma, treatment should be started 8 weeks prior to initiating radiotherapy and should continue during radiation therapy. A treatment regimen using one Goserelin 3.6 mg depot, followed in 28 days by one Goserelin 10.8 mg depot, should be administered.\nProstatic Carcinoma: For the management of advanced prostate cancer, Goserelin is intended for long-term administration unless clinically inappropriate.\nRenal or Hepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\nWomen: Goserelin 10.8 mg implant is not indicated in women as the data are insufficient to support reliable suppression of serum estradiol. For female patients requiring treatment with goserelin, refer to prescribing information for Goserelin 3.6 mg implant.",
    "Interaction": "Not available",
    "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic reactions to Goserelin have been reported in the medical literature. ZOLADEX is contraindicated in those patients who have a known hypersensitivity to GnRH, GnRH agonist analogues or any of the components in Goserelin.Pregnancy: Goserelin is contraindicated during pregnancy unless Goserelin is being used for palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer. Goserelin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. There is an increased risk for pregnancy loss due to expected hormone changes that occur with Goserelin treatment.",
    "Side Effects": "The most common, clinically significant adverse reactions occurring in >10% of men: hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, decreased erections and lower urinary tract symptoms. The adverse event profile was similar for women treated for breast cancer, dysfunctional uterine bleeding or endometriosis and included (>20%): hot flushes, headache, sweating, acne, emotional lability, depression, decreased libido, vaginitis, breast atrophy, seborrhea, and peripheral edema. Tumor flare can occur on the initiation of Goserelin\u00a0for both men and women being treated for cancer.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Goserelin is contraindicated during pregnancy unless Goserelin is being used for palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Goserelin. Based on mechanism of action in humans and findings of increased pregnancy loss in animal studies, Goserelin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. There is an increased risk for pregnancy loss due to expected hormone changes that occur with Goserelin treatment. Goserelin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits following subcutaneous administration. Administration of goserelin to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased preimplantation loss and increased resorptions. When pregnant rats received goserelin throughout gestation and lactation, there was a dose-related increase in umbilical hernia in offspring. In additional reproduction studies in rats, goserelin decreased fetus and pup survival. Human dose/exposure multiples could not be calculated from available animal data.It is not known if goserelin is excreted in human milk. Goserelin is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Goserelin, a decision should be made to either discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Women of Childbearing Potential and Pregnancy: Pregnancy must be excluded for use in benign gynecological conditions. Women should avoid pregnancy.Tumor Flare Phenomenon: Transient worsening of tumor symptoms may occur during the first few weeks of treatment with Goserelin, which may include ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression. Monitor patients at risk for complications of tumor flare.Hyperglycemia and Diabetes: Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH analogs. Monitor blood glucose level and manage according to current clinical practice.Cardiovascular Diseases: Increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH analogs in men. Monitor for cardiovascular disease and manage according to current clinical practice.Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia has been reported in patients with bone metastases treated with Goserelin. Monitor and manage appropriately.Hypersensitivity: Systemic hypersensitivity has been reported in patients receiving goserelin/ Goserelin implants.Cervical Resistance: Increase in cervical resistance may occur. Caution is recommended when dilating the cervix for endometrial ablation.Effect on QT/QTc Interval: Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval. Consider risks and benefits.Injection Site Injury: Injection site injury and vascular injury have been reported during administration of Goserelin.Depression: Depression may occur or worsen in women receiving GnRH agonists.

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation and protein regulation. However, the precise mechanism of action in plaque psoriasis is unknown. Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, tazarotenic acid, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2 and RAR\u03b3, but shows relative selectivity for RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis is unknown.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Apply a thin layer of Halotaz lotion once daily to cover only affected areas and rub gently. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the lotion. The total dosage should not exceed approximately 50 gm per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Avoid application of Halotaz lotion from oral, ophthalmic or intravaginal use.Use in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Halotaz lotion in patients under the age of 18 years have not been evaluated.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Haloperidol is a butyropherone derivative with antipsychotic properties that has been considered particularly effective in the management of hyperactivity, agitation and mania. Haloperidol is an effective neuroleptic and also possesses antiemetic properties. It may also exhibit hypothermic and anorexiant effects and potentiate the action of barbiturates, general anesthetics and other CNS depressant drugs. Haloperidol is a quick acting substance and has a duration of action of about 12 hours after one single administration. The optimum daily therapy consists of 2 administrations.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Tablet-Initial dose for adults-\n\nModerate symptomatology: 0.5 mg to 3.0 mg 2 to 3 times daily\nSevere symptomatology: 3.0 mg to 5.0 mg 2 to 3 times daily\nElderly patients: 0.5 mg to 4.5 mg 2 to 3 times daily\nChronic or Resistant patients: 3.0 mg to 6.0 mg 2 to 3 times daily\n\r\nPatients who remain severely disturbed or inadequately controlled may require dose adjustment. Daily dose upto 100 mg may be necessary in some cases to achieve optimal response. Children: A suggested dose for the management of behaviour disorders in disturbed and schizophrenic children is 50 microgram per kg body weight.Injection (intramuscular or intravenous)-Schizophrenia and other psychosis, mania:\n\nInitially 2-10 mg, then every 4-8 hours according to response to total maximum 18 mg daily\nSeverely disturbed patients may require an initial dose of up to 18 mg\nElderly (or debilitated) initially half adult dose\nFor children not recommended.",
    "Interaction": "Haloperidol has been reported to interfere with the anticoagulant properties of phenindione in an isolated case and the possibility should be kept in mind of a similar effect occurring when haloperidol is used with other anticoagulants. Haloperidol may antagonize the action of epinephrine and other sympathomimetic agents and reverse the blood pressure lowering\u00a0effects of adrenergic-blocking agents, such as guanethidine. Enhanced CNS effects may occur when haloperidol is used in combination with methyldopa. Haloperidol inhibits the metabolization of tricyclic antidepressants, thereby increasing plasma levels of these drugs. This may result in increased tricyclic antidepressant toxicity (anticholinergic effects, cardiovascular toxicity, lowering of seizure threshold). Haloperidol may impair the antiparkinson effects of levodopa. If an antiparkinson agent is used concomitantly with haloperidol, both drugs should not be discontinued simultaneously, since extrapyramidal symptoms may occur due to the slower excretion rate of haloperidol.",
    "Contraindications": "Comatose states and CNS depression due to alcohol or other depressant drugs; severe depressive states; previous spastic diseases; lesions of the basal ganglia; Parkinson's syndrome, except in the case of dyskinesias due to levodopa treatment; sensitivity to haloperidol; senile patients with pre-existing Parkinson-like symptoms.",
    "Side Effects": "Haloperidol is a safe neuroleptic. Headache, vertigo, insomnia are the more common side effects encountered. Drowsiness, lethargy, stupor, confusion, restlessness, agitation, anxiety, euphoria and exacerbation of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations also may occur. Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea and hypersalivation have also been reported.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Safety for use in pregnancy and lactation has not been established; do not administer to women of childbearing potential or nursing mothers unless, in the opinion of the physician, the expected benefits of the drug outweigh the potential hazard to the fetus or child. Haloperidol is excreted in breast milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Haloperidol may lower the convulsive threshold and has been reported to trigger seizures in previously controlled known epileptics. When instituting haloperidol therapy in these patients, adequate anticonvulsant medication should be maintained concomitantly. As with other antipsychotic agents, haloperidol should be administered cautiously to patients with severe impairment of liver or kidney function and to patients with known allergies or history of allergies to other neuroleptic drugs. Caution is also advised in patients with pheochromocytoma and conditions predisposing to epilepsy such as alcohol withdrawal and brain damage. Since the drug may have a possible potentiating effect on potent analgesics or hypnotics, caution is recommended when prescribing it to patients who are regularly treated with such drugs.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/541/halothane": {
    "name": "Halothane",
    "generic_id": "541",
    "Indications": "Halothane is a volatile anaesthetic which is suitable for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia for all types of surgery and in patients of all ages.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "When inhaled, Halothane is absorbed through the alveoli into the bloodstream. In the bloodstream, Halothane circulates through the body to the principal site of action, the brain. Here Halothane causes a progressive depression of the central nervous system, beginning with the higher centers (cerebral cortex) and spreading to the vital centers in the medulla. This depression is reversible. However, its mode of action, like all anaesthetic agents, is unknown.Halothane has a relatively low solubility in blood and therefore alveoli/blood concentrations equilibrate rapidly. The triexponential decline in Halothane blood concentrations following the end of administration is thought to represent distribution into three compartments; the vessel rich group (brain/heart/liver), the musculature and adipose tissue. Approximately 80% of the inhaled Halothane is eliminated unchanged by the lungs. The remaining 20% is metabolized in the liver by oxidative and under hypoxic conditions, reductive pathways. The main metabolites are trifluoroacetic acid, bromide and chloride salts (via the oxidative pathway) and fluoride salts (via the reductive pathway). The concentrations of metabolites peak 24 hours post-operatively and are eliminated by renal excretion during the following week.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "A number of anaesthetic vaporisers specially designed for use with Halothane are available. Open, semi-open, semi-closed and closed circuit systems have all been used with good results.For induction of anaesthesia:\n\nAdult: A concentration of 2-4% Halothane in Oxygen or Nitrous Oxide may be used.\nChildren: A concentration of 1.5-2% Halothane in Oxygen or Nitrous Oxide is used.\n\r\nFor maintenance of anaesthesia: \n\nAdults and children: A concentration of 0.5-2% is usually required for maintenance of anaesthesia. The lower concentration is usually most suitable for elderly patients.",
    "Interaction": "Increased risk of ventricular dysrhythmias with epinephrine. Increased risk of malignant hyperthermia with suxamethonium. Prolonged recovery from anaesth with concurrent use of ketamine for induction. May potentiate response to non-depolarising muscle relaxants, hypotensive agents (e.g. hexamethonium bromide, trimetaphan camsilate).",
    "Contraindications": "Halothane can induce liver damage; however, the incidence of severe liver damage (jaundice, which may lead to hepatic failure as a consequence of massive hepatic cell necrosis) is unknown. The risk of developing hepatic failure appears to be increased by repeated exposure. Although short intervals of time between exposures are likely to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity, even long intervals between exposures maynot eliminate the risks, since some patients have developed severe reactions following Halothane given many years after the previous exposures. On the information which is available at the present time, it is advised that the followingprecautions be taken\n\nA careful anaesthetic history should be taken prior to use, to determine previous exposure and previous reactions following Halothane anaesthesia.\nRepeated exposure to Halothane within a period of at least 3 months should be avoided unless there are overriding clinical circumstances.\nHistory of unexplained jaundice and pyrexia in a patient following exposure to\nHalothane is a contraindication to its future use in that patient unless absolutely essential.\nPatients should be informed if they have developed a reaction possibly related to Halothane anaesthesia; such patients should be provided with a medical alert card stating the problem.",
    "Side Effects": "Post-op nausea, vomiting, and shivering; resp depression, hypotension, skeletal muscle relaxation, bradycardia.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Although the data from experimental investigations in animals cannot be directly related to man, it would be prudent to avoid general anaesthesia with inhalation agents during early pregnancy, except where such use is essential. There are no well controlled studies with Halothane in lactating women. Halothane has been detected in breast milk of lactating women, but the effect of Halothane on breast feed neonates has not been established. However, Halothane has been in wide use for over 30 years without apparent ill consequence",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Caution should be exercised during administration of adrenaline to patients anaesthetised with Halothane as dysrhythmias may be precipitated. For this reason the dose of adrenaline should be restricted and beta-receptor antagonists administered if necessary. Ensure adequate room ventilation when Halothane is being used. Keep the concentration of Halothane in air as low as possible.Effect on ability to drive or operate machinery: Patients should be advised that performance at skilled tasks, such as driving and operating machinery, may be impaired for some time after general anaesthesia.Accidental ingestion: Cases of ingestion must be treated symptomatically.As Halothane causes relaxation of the uterine muscle; it is advisable that anaesthesia should be maintained in the lightest plane possible during obstetric operations. The use of moderate hyperventilation during neurosurgery is recommended to counteract the rise in cerebrospinal fluid pressure which may occur with Halothane Malignant hyperpyrexia has been reported in some patients receiving Halothane. This syndrome occurs with other anaesthetic agents and may respond to intravenous dantrolene sodium.During the induction of Halothane anaesthesia, a moderate fall in blood pressure commonly occurs. The pressure tends to rise when the vapour concentration is reduced to maintenance levels, but it usually remains steady below the pre-operative level. This hypotensive effect is useful in providing a clear operating field and a reduction in haemorrhage. However, if necessary, intravenous dose of methoxamine (5 mg are usually adequate) can be given to counteract the fall in blood pressure.Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported during anaesthesia. Halothane augments the action of non-depolarising muscle relaxants. Caution should be exercised during administration of adrenaline to patients anaesthetised with Halothane as dysrhythmias may be precipitated. For this reason the dose of adrenaline should be restricted and beta-receptor antagonists administered if necessary. Ensure adequate room ventilation when Halothane is being used. Keep the concentration of Halothane in air as low as possible.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "General (Inhalation) anesthetics",
    "Storage Conditions": "Bottles of Halothane must be securely closed and stored in a cool dry place, protected from light. Halothane must be kept in the original container until immediately prior to its use. Whilst in the liquid phase, Halothane must not be diluted or contaminated; however, in the vapour phase it may be administered together with Oxygen or a mixture of Nitrous Oxide and Oxygen."

    "Precautions & Warnings": "In pregnancies occurring after induction of ovulation with gonadotropic preparations, there is an increased risk of multiplets birth. Unwanted ovarianhyperstimulation: In patients treated for infertility due to anovulation or impaired follicular ripening, the prior administration of an FSH containing preparation may lead to unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. Therefore ultrasonic assessment of follicular development and determinations nations of estrogen levels should be performed prior to FSH-treatment and at regular intervals during FSH-treatment. Estrogen levels may rise very rapidly, e.g. more than a daily doubling for two or three consecutive days, and possibly reach excessively high values. If this unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation occurs (i.e. not as part of a treatment preparing for IVF/ET or GIFT/ZIFT), the administration of the FSH-containing preparation should be discontinued immediately. In that case Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin must not be given, because the administration of an LH-active gonadotrophin at this stage may induce, in addition to multiple ovulations, the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This warning is particularly important with respect to patients with polycystic ovarian disease. Clinical symptoms of mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are gastro-intestinal problems (pain, nausea, diarrhoea), painful breasts, and mild to moderate enlargement of ovaries and ovarian cysts. In rare cases severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurs, which may be life-threatening. This is characterized by large ovarian cysts (prone to rupture), ascites, often hydrothorax and occasionally",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Pharmacodynamic properties: Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin directly affects the ovaries and the testes. Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin has gametotropic and steroidogenic effect. In the ovaries, the FSH-component in Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin induces an increase in the number of growing follicles and stimulates their development. FSH increase the production of estradiol in the granulose cells by aromatizing androgens that originate in the Theca cells under the influence of the LH-component. In the testes, FSH induces the transformation of premature to mature Sertoli cells. It mainly causes the maturation of the seminal canals and development of the spermatozoa. However, a high concentration of androgens within the testes is necessary and can be attained by a prior treatment using HCG.Pharmacokinetic properties: Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin is not effective when taken orally and is injected i.m. or s.c. Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin's biological effectiveness is mainly due to its FSH and LH content. The pharmacokinetics of Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin following i.m. or s.c. administration were tested product specifically. The maximum serum level of FSH is reached 6-48 hours hours after i.m. injection and 6-36 hours after s.c. injection respectively. After that, the serum level decreases by a half-life of 56 hours (i.m.) and 51 hours (s.c.) respectively. Administered Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin is predominantly discharged renally.",

The most common local adverse reactions were pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site. The most common general adverse events were fatigue, headache, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and arthralgia.Systemic Adverse Reactions:\n\nVery common: Fever (\u226537.1\u00b0C)\nCommon: Headache, fatigue, cough, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness and vomiting\nOccasional: Hypersensitivity, allergic dermatitis, rash, dizziness and pruritus.\n\r\nLocal Adverse Reactions:\n\nVery common: Pain at the injection site\nCommon: Pruritus, induration, swelling and erythema at injection site\nOccasional: Rash and discomfort at injection site.\n\r\nMost of the above adverse reactions are mild to moderate",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: At present, there has been no independent study conducted to systematically evaluate the effect on pregnant women. The very limited data from the clinical trial showed that the accidental vaccination during pregnancy does not cause abnormal pregnancy outcomes and neonatal health conditions, and no adverse effects on pregnancy rate, pregnancy outcomes and neonatal health conditions were observed after the vaccination of HPV vaccine. However, the data are not sufficient to determine whether pregnant women are at risk of adverse pregnancy (including spontaneous abortion) after the vaccination. In animal experiments, no direct or indirect adverse effects on reproduction, pregnancy, embryo/fetus development, parturition or postnatal development are observed after the vaccination. Vaccination should be avoided during pregnancy. If a woman is pregnant or preparing for pregnancy, it is recommended to postpone or interrupt the vaccination procedure, and the vaccination can be conducted after the end of pregnancy.Lactation: There has been no relevant study data to HPV vaccine. As many drugs can be secreted in breast milk, HPV vaccine should be used with caution in lactating women.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Vaccination cannot replace the routine cervical cancer screening or other measures to prevent HPV infection and sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, routine cervical cancer screening remains extremely important as recommended by the relevant health administrative departments.Prior to the vaccination, medical personnel should inquire and review the vaccinee's medical history (especially the prior vaccination history and any prior adverse reaction related to vaccination), and conduct clinical examination to evaluate the benefits and risks of vaccination.It is not recommended for populations other than those described in of the package insert.Like other vaccines for injection, appropriate medical emergency measures and monitoring methods should be prepared to ensure that those who develop allergic reactions after the injectionSyncope (fainting) may occur after any dose of vaccine, leading to falls and injuries, especially in adolescents and young adults. Therefore, it is recommended that the observation on site be conducted for at least 30 minutes after each injection as required in the vaccination procedures.It has been reported that syncope associated with tonic-clonic seizures and other epileptiform seizures may occur after the vaccination with similar products overseas. Syncope associated with tonic-clonic seizures is usually transient, and it can be resolved spontaneously when the vaccinee is placed in a supine or head-down position and the cerebral perfusion is restored. Some vaccinees may experience psychogenic reactions before/after the vaccination, and measures should be taken to avoid injury from the syncope.Like other vaccines, the vaccination should be postponed in vaccinees with acute serious febrile illness. In case of current or recent fever symptoms, whether to postpone the vaccination depends mainly on the severity of the symptoms and their etiology. Low-grade fever and mild upper respiratory tract infection are not absolute contraindications to vaccination.The vaccine should be used with caution in vaccinees with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.Like any other vaccine, vaccination with HPV vaccine may not ensure the protective effect for all vaccinees.It is only used for preventive purposes, but not indicated for the treatment of existing HPV-related lesions or preventing the progression of lesions.It cannot prevent lesions caused by all high-risk types HPV infections. It has not been proved that it can prevent the lesions caused by the infection of non-vaccine types of HPV as well as the diseases not caused by HPV infection.There has been no data on the use of HPV vaccine in vaccinees with impaired immune system (such as receiving the medication of immunosuppressive agents). Like other vaccines, vaccination in immunocompromised people may not induce adequate immune response.",

Hypertension, either alone or as an adjunct to other antihypertensive drugs.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide promote water loss from the body (diuretics). They inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Edema: initially 25 to 50 mg daily, reduced for maintenance if possible; maximum 100 mg daily.Hypertension: 25 mg daily, increased to 50 mg daily if necessary.Elderly: in some patients, especially the elderly an initial dose of 12.5 mg daily may be sufficient.Children: An initial dose for children has been 1 to 2 mg per kg body-weight in 2 divided doses. Infants under 6 months may need doses up to 3 mg per kg daily.",
    "Interaction": "Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics: Co-administration may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. Oral and parenteral antidiabetic drugs may require adjustment of dosage with concurrent use. Other antihypertensive drugs may have an additive effect. Discontinuation of diuretic therapy 2-3 days before the initiation of treatment with an ACE inhibitor may reduce the likelihood of first-dose hypotension. The antihypertensive effect of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.Cholestyramine and colestipol resin: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resin. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids or ACTH may intensify any Thiazide-induced electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia. Pressor amines such as adrenaline may show decreased arterial responsiveness when used with hydrochlorothiazide, but this reaction is not enough to preclude their therapeutic usefulness. Non-depolarising muscle relaxants such as tubocurarine may possibly interact with Hydrochlorothiazide to increase muscle relaxation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may attenuate the diuretic and antihypertensive effects of diuretics.Drug/laboratory tests: Because thiazides may affect calcium metabolism, Hydrochlorothiazide may interfere with tests for parathyroid function.",
    "Contraindications": "Anuria, hypersensitivity to Hydrochlorothiazide or to other sulphonamide-derived drugs, severe renal or hepatic failure, Addison\u2019s disease, hypercalcemia, concurrent lithium therapy.",
    "Side Effects": "Gastro-intestinal system: Anorexia, gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhoea, constipation, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), pancreatitis, salivary gland inflammation.

Whenever side-effects are moderate to severe, thiazide dosage should be reduced or therapy was withdrawn.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Use in pregnancy: Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. The use of Hydrochlorothiazide when pregnancy is present or suspected requires, therefore, that the benefits of the drug be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus. These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions, which have occurred in the adult. The routine use of diuretics in otherwise healthy pregnant women with or without mild oedema is not recommended, because their use may be associated with hypovolaemia, increased blood viscosity and decreased placental perfusion.Use in breastfeeding mothers: Thiazides appear in breast milk. If use of the drug is deemed essential, the patient should stop breast-feeding.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Patients should be carefully monitored for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance (hyponatraemia, hypochloraemic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia). It is particularly important to make serum and urine electrolyte determinations when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, seizures, confusion, muscle pains or cramps, muscle fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastro-intestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalaemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Hypokalaemia can sensitise or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g. increased ventricular irritability). Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Hypokalaemia may be avoided or treated in the adult by concurrent use of amiloride hydrochloride, a potassium conserving agent. It may also be avoided by giving potassium chloride or foods with a high potassium content. Diuretic-induced hyponatraemia is usually mild and asymptomatic. Dilutional hyponatraemia may occur in oedematous patients in hot weather; and, except in rare instances when hyponatraemia is life-threatening, appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt. Thiazides may decrease serum protein bound iodine levels without signs of thyroid disturbances. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion, and may also cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. When creatinine clearance falls below 30ml/min, thiazide diuretics become ineffective. Uraemia may be precipitated or increased by chlorothiazide. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. If increasing uraemia and oliguria occur during treatment of renal disease, Hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Hyperuricaemia may occur, or gout may be precipitated, in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Thaizide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported. Latent diabetes may become manifest during thiazide administration.",

    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "Hydrocortisone binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.",

Read moreHydroxocobalamin is indicated for the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning.Identifying Patients with Cyanide Poisoning: Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires. Sources of cyanide poisoning include\u00a0hydrogen cyanide\u00a0and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside.The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, Hydroxocobalamin should be administered without delay.In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.Smoke Inhalation: Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns,\u00a0trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a\u00a0diagnosis\u00a0of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of Hydroxocobalamin, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following:\n\nExposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area\nPresence of soot around the\u00a0mouth,\u00a0nose\u00a0or\u00a0oropharynx\nAltered mental status\n\r\nAlthough hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims.

    "Pharmacology": "The mechanism by which progesterone prevents preterm birth is not well understood, but many pathways are likely involved. (1) Progesterone plays a vital role in regulation of the female reproductive system and is important for successful implantation of the embryo and maintenance of pregnancy. It acts by binding to progesterone receptors in the uterus, ovaries, breasts and in the central nervous system. These receptors exist in 2 isoforms, PR-A and PR-B. Progesterone binding to these receptors ultimately leads to regulation of gene transcription. (2) This results in an anti-inflammatory effect which blunts the proinflammatory state that occurs with initiation of labor, and maintains uterine queiscence by stabilizing progesterone acting on the myometrium.",

  "https://medex.com.bd/generics/592/ibandronic-acid": {
    "name": "Ibandronic Acid",
    "generic_id": "592",
    "Indications": "Ibandronic Acid is indicated for the:\n\nTreatment of osteoporosis in women (specially postmenopausal)\nPrevention of osteoporosis in women (specially postmenopausal)\nPrevention and treatment of osteoporosis in men\n\r\nTreatment of Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis ... Read moreIbandronic Acid is indicated for the:\n\nTreatment of osteoporosis in women (specially postmenopausal)\nPrevention of osteoporosis in women (specially postmenopausal)\nPrevention and treatment of osteoporosis in men\n\r\nTreatment of Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis may be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass (T-score <-2.0 SD) and the presence or history of osteoporotic fracture, or a low bone mass (T-score <-2.5 SD) in the absence of documented pre-existing osteoporotic fracture.",
    "Composition": "Not available",
    "Pharmacology": "The pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic acid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, tumors or tumor extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also inhibited, leading to increased bone mass compared with untreated animals. Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times the dose required for osteoporosis treatment. The high potency and therapeutic margin of ibandronic acid allows for more flexible dosing regimens and intermittent treatment with long drug-free intervals at comparatively low doses.Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of bisphosphonates, which act on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity, It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. The selective action of ibandronic acid on bone tissue is based on the high affinity of this compound for hydroxyapatite, which represents the mineral matrix of the bone. Ibandronic acid reduces bone resorption, with no direct effect on bone formation. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover towards premenopausal levels, leading to a progressive net gain in bone mass. Daily or intermittent administration of ibandronic acid results in reduced bone resorption as reflected in reduced levels of serum and urinary biochemical markers of bone turnover, increased BMD and a decreased incidence of fractures.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended dose of Ibandronic acid for treatment is one 150 mg film-coated tablet once a month. The tablet should preferably be taken on the same date each month. Ibandronic acid should be taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or any other oral medication or supplementation (including calcium):\n\nTablets should be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (180 to 240 ml) while the patient is sitting or standing in an upright position. Patients should not lie down for 60 minutes after taking Ibandronic acid.\nPlain water is the only drink that should be taken with Ibandronic acid. Please note that some mineral waters may have a higher concentration of calcium and therefore should not be used.\nPatients should not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration. Patients should receive supplemental calcium or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. In case a once-monthly dose is missed, patients should be instructed to take one Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet the morning after the tablet is remembered unless the time to the next scheduled dose is within 7 days. Patients should then return to taking their dose once a month on their originally scheduled date. If the next scheduled dose is within 7 days, patients should wait until their next dose and then continue taking one tablet once a month as originally scheduled. Patients should not take two 150 mg tablets within the same week.",
    "Interaction": "It is likely that calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications containing multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with the absorption of Ibandronic Acid. Therefore, patients must wait 60 minutes after taking Ibandronic Acid before taking other oral medications. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in postmenopausal women have demonstrated the absence of any interaction potential with tamoxifen or hormone replacement therapy (estrogen). No interaction was observed when co-administered with melphalan/prednisolone in patients with multiple myeloma. In healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, i.v. ranitidine caused an increase in ibandronic acid bioavailability of about 20 %, probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity. However, since this increase is within the normal range of the bioavailability of ibandronic acid, no dosage adjustment is required when Ibandronic Acid is administered with H2-antagonists or other drugs which increase gastric pH.In relation to disposition, no drug interactions of clinical significance are considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats. Furthermore, plasma protein binding is low at therapeutic concentrations and ibandronic acid is therefore unlikely to displace other drugs. Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation. The secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the excretion of other drugs. In a one-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM16549). the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in patients concomitantly taking aspirin or NSAIDs was similar in patients taking Ibandronic Acid 2.5 mg daily or 150mg once monthly. Of over 1500 patients enrolled in study BM 16549 comparing monthly with daily dosing regimens of ibandronic acid, 14% of patients used histamine (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in the patients treated with Ibandronic Acid 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients treated with Ibandronic Acid 2.5 mg daily.",
    "Contraindications": "Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients. Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected hypocalcemia. As with all bisphosphonates indicated in the treatment of osteoporosis, pre-existing hypocalcemia needs to be corrected before initiating therapy with Ibandronic Acid. As with several bisphosphonates, Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia. Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients who are unable to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes.",
    "Side Effects": "The main side effects of ibandronic acid are dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy: Ibandronic Acid should not be used during pregnancy. There was no evidence for a direct fetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid in daily orally treated rats and rabbits and there were no adverse effects on the development in F1 offspring in rats. Adverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive toxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class. They include a decreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase in visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome). Specific studies for the monthly regimen have not been performed. There is no clinical experience with Ibandronic Acid in pregnant women.Nursing Mothers: Ibandronic Acid should not be used during lactation. In lactating rats treated with 0.08 mg/kg/day IV. ibandronic acid, the highest concentration of ibandronic acid in breast milk was 8.1 ng/ml and was seen in the first 2 hours after i.v. administration. After 24 hours, the concentration in milk and plasma was similar, and corresponded to about 5 % of the concentration measured after 2 hours.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be effectively treated before starting Ibandronic Acid therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. Orally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when Ibandronic Acid is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (e.g. known Barrett\u2019s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Adverse experiences such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, in some cases severe and requiring hospitalization, rarely with bleeding or followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with the dosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention and be able to comply with the dosing instructions.Physicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue Ibandronic Acid and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. While no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications. Since NSAIDs and bisphosphonates are both associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant medication with Ibandronic Acid. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates. Most cases have been in cancer patients undergoing dental procedures, but some have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis or other diagnoses. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids), and co-morbid disorders (e.g., anemia, coagulopathy, infection, pre-existing dental disease). Most reported cases have been in patients treated with bisphosphonates intravenously but some have been in patients treated orally. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit-risk assessment.",
